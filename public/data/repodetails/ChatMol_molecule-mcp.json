  "readme": "# Molecule-MCP\n**Molecule-MCP**: A model-context-protocol server for molecules.\nMolecule-MCP connects molecule science releated tools to Claude AI through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing Claude to **directly interact with and control these tools and act as a co-scientist**. This integration enables prompt assisted molecule modeling.\n\n![Molecule MCP](./assets/chimerax.jpg)\n\n## Installation\n⚠️ **Note**: Molecule-MCP requires Claude Desktop to be installed and running.\n1. Go to Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config > claude_desktop_config.json to include the following:\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"pymol\": {\n      \"command\": \"/path/to/mcp\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"/path/to/molecule-mcp/pymol_server.py\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"chimerax\": {\n      \"command\": \"/path/to/mcp\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"/path/to/molecule-mcp/ChimeraX_server.py\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"gromacs_copilot\": {\n      \"command\": \"/path/to/mcp\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"/path/to/molecule-mcp/mcp_server.py\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n2. Install mcp and get the script\n```bash\npip install \"mcp[cli]\" chatmol\npip install git+https://github.com/ChatMol/gromacs_copilot.git # optional, for running gromacs_copilot\nwhich mcp\n```\nthe path to mcp will be displayed. Copy this path for the next step and replace `/path/to/mcp` with the path to mcp.\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/ChatMol/molecule-mcp.git\ncd molecule-mcp\npwd\n```\nthe path to molecule-mcp will be displayed. Copy this path for the next step and replace `/path/to/molecule-mcp` with the path to molecule-mcp.\n\n## Disclaimer\nMolecule-MCP is provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
