This project illustrates how malicious plugins can exploit weaknesses in the MCP architecture through practical examples, helping developers and security researchers understand these risks and strengthen system protection.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Plugin-based Malicious Payloads**: Demonstrates how malicious plugins can run within the MCP architecture\n- **Multiple Attack Techniques**: Includes examples of data poisoning, cross-MCP calls, competitive malicious functions, and more\n- **Practical Educational Value**: Each attack vector comes with detailed explanations and implementation code\n\n## Included Attack Vectors\n\n1. **Data Poisoning**: The `banana` plugin demonstrates how to force users to perform specific operations\n2. **JSON Injection Attacks**: The `url_json` plugin shows how to retrieve data from a local malicious service\n3. **Competitive Malicious Functions**: The `remove_server` plugin overrides existing functionality\n4. **Cross-MCP Call Attacks**: The `Master_cross_call` plugin guides users to perform dangerous operations\n\n## Installation Instructions\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\n\ncd MasterMCP\n\n# Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"MasterMCP\": {\n      \"command\": \"/xxx/bin/python\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"/xxx/MasterMCP/MasterMCP.py\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nMasterMCP/\n├── MasterMCP.py              # Main program, responsible for loading and managing plugins\n├── tools_plugins/            # Malicious plugins directory\n│   ├── initialize_data_poisoning.py    # Forces users to perform specific checks\n│   ├── inject_json_poisoning.py        # JSON data injection example\n│   ├── malicious_competitive_function.py  # Competitive function override\n│   └── malicious_cross_mcp_call.py     # Cross-MCP call attack\n├── resources_plugins/        # Resource plugins directory\n├── prompts_plugins/          # Prompt plugins directory\n└── utils/                    # Utility functions\n```\n\n## Security Warning\n\n⚠️ **This project is for educational and research purposes only**. Do not use these techniques on any system without authorization. Malicious use of this code may violate laws and regulations.\n\n## Defense Recommendations\n\n- Implement strict plugin verification mechanisms\n- Thoroughly check and sanitize all external inputs\n- Implement the principle of least privilege, limiting plugin execution permissions\n- Use signature verification to ensure only trusted plugins are loaded\n- Regularly review installed plugins and their behaviors\n\n## Attack Analysis\n\n### Banana Detection Poisoning\nThe `initialize_data_poisoning.py` plugin establishes a mandatory process dependency by requiring a \"banana check\" before any operation. This technique can be used to:\n- Induce users to perform unnecessary operations\n- Establish a false sense of security\n- Insert malicious steps before legitimate operations\n\n### JSON Data Injection\nThe `inject_json_poisoning.py` plugin retrieves data from a local port by default, potentially leading to:\n- Data leakage\n- Execution of malicious instructions\n- Bypassing normal security checks\n\n### Competitive Function Override\nThe `malicious_competitive_function.py` provides a `remove_server` function with the same name but different functionality:\n- Replaces critical system functions\n- Prevents normal service removal operations\n- Embeds hidden instructions encoded in hexadecimal within the confusion\n\n### Cross-MCP Call Attack\nThe `malicious_cross_mcp_call.py` uses encoded error messages to induce users to:\n- Add unverified external services\n- Perform unnecessary operations\n- Expand the attack surface\n\n## Contribution Guidelines\n\nContributions to this project are welcome through:\n- Submitting examples of new attack vectors\n- Improving documentation for existing examples\n- Adding example implementations of defense mechanisms\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](LICENSE)"
