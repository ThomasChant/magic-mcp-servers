  "readme": "# Bazel MCP Server\n\nThis project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes tools for interacting with Bazel projects.\n\n**Status:** ðŸš§ Under Active Development ðŸš§\n\nFeatures and interfaces may change.\n\n## Features\n\nThis server currently provides the following tools:\n\n*   **`build`:** Builds a specified Bazel target.\n*   **`deps`:** Finds the dependencies of a given Bazel target, with an optional depth parameter.\n*   **`rdeps` (Reverse Dependencies):** Finds all Bazel targets that depend on a given target or file path, with an optional depth parameter.\n*   **`sources`:** Finds the direct source files associated with a given Bazel target.\n*   **`test`:** Runs tests for a specified Bazel target.\n\n## Usage with Claude Desktop\n\nThis server is designed to be used as a tool provider for applications like the Claude Desktop app.\n\n### 1. Installation\n\nInstall the server using `go install`:\n\n```bash\n# Ensure your Go environment is set up (GOPATH, GOBIN, etc.)\ngo install github.com/aaomidi/mcp-bazel@latest\n```\n\nThis command compiles and installs the `mcp-bazel` binary. By default, it's placed in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory or `$HOME/go/bin` if `GOPATH` is not set. Make sure this location is in your system's `PATH` or note the full path to the binary for the next step.\n\n### 2. Configuration\n\nAdd the following configuration to your Claude Desktop settings file (`claude_desktop_config.json`). You can usually find this file via the app's settings menu (\"Open Config Folder\").\n\nModify the `\"command\"` path to point to the actual location where `go install` placed the `mcp-bazel` binary on your system.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-bazel\": {\n      \"command\": \"/path/to/your/go/bin/mcp-bazel\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Restart Claude Desktop\n\nAfter saving the configuration file, restart the Claude Desktop app. The Bazel tools should now be available.\n"
