  "readme": "# mcp-sequentialthinking-qa\n\nAn adaptation of the\n[MCP Sequential Thinking Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/sequentialthinking/index.ts)\ndesigned to guide tool usage in QA and verification processes. This\nserver helps break down verification tasks into manageable steps and\nprovides recommendations for which MCP tools would be most effective\nat each stage.\n\nA Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that combines sequential\nthinking with intelligent tool suggestions for QA tasks. For each step\nin the verification process, it provides confidence-scored\nrecommendations for which tools to use, along with rationale for why\neach tool would be appropriate.\n\n## Features\n\n- ü§î Dynamic and reflective problem-solving through sequential\n  thoughts\n- üîÑ Flexible thinking process that adapts and evolves\n- üå≥ Support for branching and revision of thoughts\n- üõ†Ô∏è Intelligent tool recommendations for each QA step\n- üìä Confidence scoring for tool suggestions\n- üîç Detailed rationale for tool recommendations\n- üìù Step tracking with expected outcomes\n- üîÑ Progress monitoring with previous and remaining steps\n- üéØ Alternative tool suggestions for each step\n\n## Specialized QA Workflows\n\nThe server includes specialized workflows for common QA tasks:\n\n1. **Version Verification**: Validates package versions and\n   compatibility\n2. **Syntax Validation**: Verifies code syntax against best practices\n3. **Compatibility Check**: Ensures compatibility between different\n   versions or components\n4. **Test Workflow**: A workflow primarily used for testing the\n   sequential thinking QA system itself.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThis server analyses each step of your verification process and\nrecommends appropriate MCP tools to help accomplish the task. Each\nrecommendation includes:\n\n- A confidence score (0-1) indicating how well the tool matches the\n  current need\n- A clear rationale explaining why the tool would be helpful\n- A priority level to suggest tool execution order\n- Alternative tools that could also be used\n\nThe server works with any MCP tools available in your environment. It\nprovides recommendations based on the current step's requirements, but\nthe actual tool execution is handled by the consumer (like Claude).\n\nThe server also supports creating branches to explore different\napproaches or revising previous thoughts to correct errors or\nincorporate new information, allowing for a flexible and adaptive QA\nprocess.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nHere's an example of how the server guides tool usage for version\nverification:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"thought\": \"Need to verify Tailwind CSS version before implementing configuration\",\n\t\"current_step\": {\n\t\t\"step_description\": \"Check installed Tailwind version in package.json\",\n\t\t\"expected_outcome\": \"Confirmed Tailwind version\",\n\t\t\"recommended_tools\": [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"tool_name\": \"read_file\",\n\t\t\t\t\"confidence\": 0.9,\n\t\t\t\t\"rationale\": \"Examine package.json to determine installed version\",\n\t\t\t\t\"priority\": 1\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"tool_name\": \"execute_command\",\n\t\t\t\t\"confidence\": 0.7,\n\t\t\t\t\"rationale\": \"Run npm list to check installed version\",\n\t\t\t\t\"priority\": 2\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t],\n\t\t\"next_step_conditions\": [\n\t\t\t\"Version identified\",\n\t\t\t\"Check for breaking changes between versions\"\n\t\t]\n\t},\n\t\"thought_number\": 1,\n\t\"total_thoughts\": 4,\n\t\"next_thought_needed\": true\n}\n```\n\nThe server tracks your progress and supports:\n\n- Creating branches to explore different approaches\n- Revising previous thoughts with new information\n- Maintaining context across multiple steps\n- Suggesting next steps based on current findings\n\n## Configuration\n\nThis server requires configuration through your MCP client. Here are\nexamples for different environments:\n\n### Cline Configuration\n\nAdd this to your Cline MCP settings:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"mcpServers\": {\n\t\t\"mcp-sequentialthinking-qa\": {\n\t\t\t\"command\": \"npx\",\n\t\t\t\"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-sequentialthinking-qa\"]\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Claude Desktop with WSL Configuration\n\nFor WSL environments, add this to your Claude Desktop configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"mcpServers\": {\n\t\t\"mcp-sequentialthinking-qa\": {\n\t\t\t\"command\": \"wsl.exe\",\n\t\t\t\"args\": [\n\t\t\t\t\"bash\",\n\t\t\t\t\"-c\",\n\t\t\t\t\"source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && /home/username/.nvm/versions/node/v20.12.1/bin/npx mcp-sequentialthinking-qa\"\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## API\n\nThe server implements a single MCP tool with configurable parameters:\n\n### sequentialthinking_qa\n\nA tool for QA-focused sequential thinking with tool recommendations\nfor verification tasks.\n\nParameters:\n\n- `thought` (string, required): Your current thinking step in the QA\n  process\n- `next_thought_needed` (boolean, required): Whether another thought\n  step is needed\n- `thought_number` (integer, required): Current thought number\n- `total_thoughts` (integer, required): Estimated total thoughts\n  needed\n- `verification_target` (string, optional): What's being verified\n  (code, config, etc.)\n- `current_step` (object, optional): Current step recommendation with:\n  - `step_description`: What needs to be done\n  - `recommended_tools`: Array of tool recommendations with confidence\n    scores\n  - `expected_outcome`: What to expect from this step\n  - `next_step_conditions`: Conditions for next step\n- `previous_steps` (array, optional): Steps already recommended\n- `remaining_steps` (array, optional): High-level descriptions of\n  upcoming steps\n\n## Development\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Clone the repository\n2. Install dependencies:\n\n```bash\npnpm install\n```\n\n3. Build the project:\n\n```bash\npnpm build\n```\n\n4. Run in development mode:\n\n```bash\npnpm dev\n```\n\n### Publishing\n\nThe project uses changesets for version management. To publish:\n\n1. Create a changeset:\n\n```bash\npnpm changeset\n```\n\n2. Version the package:\n\n```bash\npnpm changeset version\n```\n\n3. Publish to npm:\n\n```bash\npnpm release\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
