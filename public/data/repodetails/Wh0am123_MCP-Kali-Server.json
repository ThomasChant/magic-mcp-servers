  "readme": "# MCP Kali Server\n\n**Kali MCP Server** is a lightweight API bridge that connects MCP Clients (e.g: Claude Desktop, [5ire](https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire)) to the API server which allows excuting commands on a Linux terminal.\n\nThis allows the MCP to run terminal commands like `nmap`, `nxc` or any other tool, interact with web applications using tools like `curl`, `wget`, `gobuster`. \n And perform **AI-assisted penetration testing**, solving **CTF web challenge** in real time, helping in **solving machines from HTB or THM**.\n\n## My Medium Article on This Tool\n\n[![How MCP is Revolutionizing Offensive Security](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*g4h-mIpPEHpq_H63W7Emsg.png)](https://yousofnahya.medium.com/how-mcp-is-revolutionizing-offensive-security-93b2442a5096)\n\nüëâ [**How MCP is Revolutionizing Offensive Security**](https://yousofnahya.medium.com/how-mcp-is-revolutionizing-offensive-security-93b2442a5096)\n\n---\n\n## üîç Use Case\n\nThe goal is to enable AI-driven offensive security testing by:\n\n- Letting the MCP interact with AI endpoints like OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, or any other models.\n- Exposing an API to execute commands on a Kali machine.\n- Using AI to suggest and run terminal commands to solve CTF challenges or automate recon/exploitation tasks.\n- Allowing MCP apps to send custom requests (e.g., `curl`, `nmap`, `ffuf`, etc.) and receive structured outputs.\n\nHere are some example for my testing (I used google's AI `gemini 2.0 flash`)\n\n### Example solving my web CTF challenge in RamadanCTF\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc93b71d-9a4a-4ad5-8079-2c26c04e5397\n\n### Trying to solve machine \"code\" from HTB\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ec06ff8-0bdf-4ad5-be71-2ec490b7ee27\n\n\n---\n\n## üöÄ Features\n\n- üß† **AI Endpoint Integration**: Connect your kali to any MCP of your liking such as claude desktop or 5ier.\n- üñ•Ô∏è **Command Execution API**: Exposes a controlled API to execute terminal commands on your Kali Linux machine.\n- üï∏Ô∏è **Web Challenge Support**: AI can interact with websites and APIs, capture flags via `curl` and any other tool AI the needs.\n- üîê **Designed for Offensive Security Professionals**: Ideal for red teamers, bug bounty hunters, or CTF players automating common tasks.\n\n---\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Installation\n\n### On your Linux Machine (Will act as MCP Server)\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Wh0am123/MCP-Kali-Server.git\ncd MCP-Kali-Server\npython3 kali_server.py\n```\n\n### On your MCP Client (You can run on Windows or Linux)\n- You will want to run `python3 /absolute/path/to/mcp_server.py http://LINUX_IP:5000`\n\n#### Configuration for claude desktop:\nedit (C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json)\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"kali_mcp\": {\n            \"command\": \"python3\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"/absolute/path/to/mcp_server.py\",\n                \"http://LINUX_IP:5000/\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configuration for [5ire](https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire) Desktop Application:\n- Simply add an MCP with the command `python3 /absolute/path/to/mcp_server.py http://LINUX_IP:5000` and it will automatically generate the needed configuration files.\n\n## üîÆ Other Possibilities\n\nThere are more possibilites than described since the AI model can now execute commands on the terminal. Here are some example:\n\n- Memory forensics using Volatility\n  - Automating memory analysis tasks such as process enumeration, DLL injection checks, and registry extraction from memory dumps.\n\n- Disk forensics with SleuthKit\n  - Automating analysis from disk images, timeline generation, file carving, and hash comparisons.\n\n\n## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:\nThis project is intended solely for educational and ethical testing purposes.
