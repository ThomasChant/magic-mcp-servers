  "readme": "# Sequential Thinking MCP Server\n\nAn MCP server implementation that provides a tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through a structured thinking process.\n\n## Features\n\n- Break down complex problems into manageable steps\n- Revise and refine thoughts as understanding deepens\n- Branch into alternative paths of reasoning\n- Adjust the total number of thoughts dynamically\n- Generate and verify solution hypotheses\n\n## Tool\n\n### sequential_thinking\n\nFacilitates a detailed, step-by-step thinking process for problem-solving and analysis.\n\n**Inputs:**\n- `thought` (string): The current thinking step\n- `nextThoughtNeeded` (boolean): Whether another thought step is needed\n- `thoughtNumber` (integer): Current thought number\n- `totalThoughts` (integer): Estimated total thoughts needed\n- `isRevision` (boolean, optional): Whether this revises previous thinking\n- `revisesThought` (integer, optional): Which thought is being reconsidered\n- `branchFromThought` (integer, optional): Branching point thought number\n- `branchId` (string, optional): Branch identifier\n- `needsMoreThoughts` (boolean, optional): If more thoughts are needed\n\n## Usage\n\nThe Sequential Thinking tool is designed for:\n- Breaking down complex problems into steps\n- Planning and design with room for revision\n- Analysis that might need course correction\n- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially\n- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps\n- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Usage with Claude Desktop\n\nAdd this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n#### npx\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"sequential-thinking\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### docker\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"sequentialthinking\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"mcp/sequentialthinking\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Usage with VS Code\n\nFor quick installation, click one of the installation buttons below...\n\n[![Install with NPX in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-NPM-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=sequentialthinking&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40modelcontextprotocol%2Fserver-sequential-thinking%22%5D%7D) [![Install with NPX in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-NPM-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=sequentialthinking&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40modelcontextprotocol%2Fserver-sequential-thinking%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders)\n\n[![Install with Docker in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Docker-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=sequentialthinking&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22mcp%2Fsequentialthinking%22%5D%7D) [![Install with Docker in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Docker-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=sequentialthinking&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22mcp%2Fsequentialthinking%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders)\n\nFor manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`.\n\nOptionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.\n\n> Note that the `mcp` key is not needed in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.\n\nFor NPX installation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"sequential-thinking\": {\n        \"command\": \"npx\",\n        \"args\": [\n          \"-y\",\n          \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking\"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor Docker installation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"sequential-thinking\": {\n        \"command\": \"docker\",\n        \"args\": [\n          \"run\",\n          \"--rm\",\n          \"-i\",\n          \"mcp/sequentialthinking\"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Building\n\nDocker:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t mcp/sequentialthinking -f src/sequentialthinking/Dockerfile .\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis MCP server is licensed under the MIT License.
