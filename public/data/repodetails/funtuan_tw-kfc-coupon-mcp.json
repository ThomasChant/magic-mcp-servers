  "readme": "# KFC Coupon Server\n\n## Introduction\nThis project is a small tribute to my passion for KFC, built to help others discover great deals using a coupon server. A huge **thank you** to [Winedays/KCouper](https://github.com/Winedays/KCouper) for curating and sharing the KFC coupon data, which made this project possible!\n\n## Features\nThis project provides a simple server to search for KFC Taiwan coupons based on specific criteria. Key features include:\n\n- **Coupon Search**: Find coupons by keywords (e.g., \"炸雞\" for fried chicken, \"蛋撻\" for egg tarts) or price ranges.\n- **Data Integration**: Pulls coupon data from the [KCouper repository](https://github.com/Winedays/KCouper) and transforms it into a structured format.\n- **MCP Protocol**: Uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose a tool for querying coupons, making it compatible with AI-driven applications.\n\n## Example Usage\nTo use the MCP server for querying KFC coupons, you can configure it as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"kfc-coupon\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@funtuantw/tw-kfc-coupon-mcp\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis configuration allows you to integrate the KFC coupon MCP server into your application seamlessly. Simply execute the command to start querying coupons based on your criteria.\n\n## Acknowledgments\nSpecial thanks to [Winedays/KCouper](https://github.com/Winedays/KCouper) for their amazing work in collecting and organizing KFC coupon data. Their open-source contribution inspired and enabled this project."
