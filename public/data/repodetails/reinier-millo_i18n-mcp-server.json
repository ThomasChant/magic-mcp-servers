  "readme": "# üåê i18n MCP Server\n\ni18n MCP Server is a powerful tool for managing internationalization (i18n) in your projects. It streamlines the\nprocess of translating JSON-based language files by allowing you to use powerful language models to generate\ntranslations directly from a base language file ‚Äî all through a convenient server interface.\n\n**The MCP server is intended to work with the Cursor IDE using stdio transport. It should also work properly with any\nclient that supports stdio transport.**\n\n## üí° Why i18n MCP Server?\n\n- Save hours of manual translation work\n- Keep your i18n files consistent and up to date\n- Eliminate repetitive copy/paste tasks when scaling your app globally.\n\n## üöÄ Features\n\n### üåç Multi-language support\n\nAutomatically generate translations in multiple languages from a single base language file.\n\n### ü§ñ Translate using models on Cursor\n\nYou don't need to pay for additional translation services. Select the translation model you want to use and generate\ntranslations on demand.\n\n### ‚ö° Effortless workflow\n\nNo need to manually duplicate or edit JSON files ‚Äî just send a request and get translated files ready to use.\n\n### üõ†Ô∏è Developer-friendly\n\nBuilt with simplicity and speed in mind for seamless integration into development pipelines.\n\n## Working flow\n\nThis MCP server helps with incremental translation of JSON files. It provides simple tools to:\n\n1. Get the base language file with all texts in a single language and the set of supported languages.\n2. Get chunks of strings to translate. Each chunk will be a list of texts separated by new lines.\n3. Update generated translations in the memory cache.\n4. Save translations to language-specific JSON files.\n\n## üì¶ Installation and configuration\n\n1. Clone the repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n\n```bash\npnpm install # or npm/yarn\n```\n\n3. Build the server:\n\n```bash\npnpm run build\n```\n\n4. Configure the MCP server on Cursor\n\nNavigate to `Cursor Settings / MCP` and click to add a new MCP server. In the opened JSON, include the server\ndefinition:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    ...\n    \"i18n-translation-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"<base-path>/i18n-mcp/dist/mcp_server.js\"]\n    },\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou will need to replace `<base-path>` with the correct absolute path to the compiled server.\n\n## üì§ Usage\n\nOnce the MCP server is running, you can use the Cursor Agent to interact with the server tools. For example:\n\n```\nWe are preparing the i18n files for a project and have a base language file. Using the following data, execute the\nproposed tasks to prepare the additional required languages.\n\nBase JSON language file: <absolute path to the base language file>\nBase language: <base language>\nSupported languages: <comma-separated list of supported languages>\n\nThese are the tasks that we need to perform:\n\n1. Clear the previous data\n2. Read the base JSON language file\n3. Get the next chunk\n4. For each language in the supported languages, do the following subtasks:\n   4.1. Translate all items in the chunk from the base language to the target language. Ensure that the order is\n   preserved and that any i18n string parameters are respected.\n   4.2. Update the translations for the language\n5. Repeat from task 3 until the next chunk does not return any data.\n6. After processing all chunks, save translations for each supported language.\n```\n\nThis request will generate a JSON file for each language in the same folder as the base JSON language file. The current\nversion was tested using `gpt-4.1` and a chunk size of **250** entries. For other models, this value may need to be\nadjusted due to token limits. Another issue that may occur is that the flow can sometimes be interrupted between steps\n5 and 6, requiring manual resumption due to the 25 tool call restriction in Cursor.\n\nThis is just a proposed task request, but new ones can be written by chaining the defined tools.\n\n**During testing, we noted that language files are generated faster when generating a single language per request,\ninstead of all at once. Additionally, the response time will depend on the model used.**\n\n## üìö Future Plans\n\n- Support for multiple caches\n- Language file integrity check\n- Support dynamic chunk size\n- Translation only for missing entries\n- Translation only for specific items\n- Version tracking for language files\n- Better local cache for translations\n\n## üôå Contributing\n\nPull requests and issues are welcome! Let's build a better translation workflow together.\n\n## üìÑ License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE).
