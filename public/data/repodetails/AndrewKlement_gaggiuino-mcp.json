It is designed to integrate easily AI clients that want to display or analyze data from the Gaggiuino system in real time.\n\nThis is an article I wrote about this project https://medium.com/@a.klement.w/dialing-in-espresso-using-mcp-server-0207819fe93a\n\n<a href=\"https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/@AndrewKlement/gaggiuino-mcp\">\n  <img width=\"380\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/@AndrewKlement/gaggiuino-mcp/badge\" alt=\"Gaggiuino Server MCP server\" />\n</a>\n\n## Allows connected clients to:\n\n- Retrieve the current machine status\n\n- Access the latest shot ID\n\n- Fetch shot data for a specified id \n\n## Features\nüìä Real-time access to shot telemetry\n\nüåê Designed for local network access\n\n## How to use\n\n### Using Claude Desktop\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n      \"gaggiuino\": {\n          \"command\": \"uv\",\n          \"args\": [\n              \"--directory\",\n              \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/gaggiuino-mcp\",\n              \"run\",\n              \"gaggiuino.py\"\n          ]\n      }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Installing via Smithery\n\nTo install Gaggiuino Espresso Machine Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@AndrewKlement/gaggiuino-mcp):\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install @AndrewKlement/gaggiuino-mcp --client claude\n```\n\n### Available Toolsets\n\n| Toolset                 | Description                                                   |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `getLatestShotId`       | Get latest espresso shot id                                   |\n| `getShotData`           | Get espresso shot data for an id.

Let me first check the status of your espresso machine and then get the latest shot information.\n`getStatus`\nNow I'll get the ID of the latest espresso shot:\n`getLatestShotId`\nLet me retrieve the data for shot #188:\n`getShotData`\nBased on the data retrieved, I'll now analyze your latest espresso shot (ID #188). Here's my analysis:\n\nMachine Status and Shot Overview\nYour machine is currently idle at 57.2¬∞C with -0.1 bar pressure. The shot analyzed was taken on April 19, 2025 (based on the timestamp), with a total duration of \n26.5 seconds (265 datapoints at 0.1s intervals).\n\nProfile Information\nYou used the \"Leva 9 LR v0.5\" profile, which is a multi-phase profile with declining pressure targeting 40g of output. The profile has\n1. A flow-control preinfusion at 7 ml/s\n2. Step-down to 3.5 ml/s flow\n3. Pre-extraction at 1.5 ml/s flow with 3 bar pressure restriction\n4. Pressure ramp to 9 bar over 2 seconds\n5. A series of gradually declining pressure steps (8.8‚Üí6.0 bar)\n\nShot Analysis\nPreinfusion and Extraction Phases\n- Preinfusion (0-5s): Started with a high flow rate (6-7 ml/s) with minimal pressure (0.3-0.6 bar), allowing the puck to saturate.\n- First Pressure Rise (5-10s): Pressure gradually built to ~2.5 bar while flow decreased to ~1.5 ml/s.\n- Pressure Profile Phase (10-15s): Pressure held around 3 bar with flow reduced to ~0.8 ml/s.\n- Pressure Ramp (15-20s): Pressure increased from 3 to 8.9 bar over ~5 seconds following the programmed profile.\n- Declining Pressure Phase (20-26.5s): Pressure gradually declined from ~8.5 to 6.4 bar following the profile steps.\n\nKey Measurements\n- Final Yield: 38g (based on final shot weight)\n- Brew Ratio: Unable to determine (coffee dose not provided)\n- Temperature Stability: Excellent - maintained at 92.8-94.1¬∞C throughout extraction\n- First Drops: Appeared around 11-12 seconds (~75% into preinfusion)\n- Peak Flow Rate: 7.2 ml/s (at the beginning)\n- Peak Pressure: 8.9 bar (at ~20 seconds)\n\nExtraction Dynamics\n1. Flow Rate: Started high (7 ml/s), stepped down to 3.5 ml/s then 1.5 ml/s during preinfusion as programmed, then stabilized at ~2.8 ml/s during extraction.\n2. Water Delivery: Total water pumped was 87.7 ml, with 38g in the cup, suggesting significant water retention in the puck.\n3. Pressure Profile: The pressure curve shows excellent progression from preinfusion through extraction, with a smooth transition to declining pressure.\n\nPerformance Assessment\nThis appears to be a technically well-executed shot with good adherence to the programmed profile:\n- Temperature Control: Excellent stability around 93-94¬∞C\n- Pressure Curve: Follows the programmed profile with smooth transitions\n- Extraction Flow: Consistent during main extraction phase\n- Weight Output: Achieved 38g (close to the 40g target)\n\nWould you like me to provide more specific recommendations about any aspect of this shot, or is there a particular parameter you'd like me to analyze in more detail?\n"
