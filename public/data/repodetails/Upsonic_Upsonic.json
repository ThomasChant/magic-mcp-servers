It enables trusted agent workflows in your organization through advanced reliability features, including verification layers, triangular architecture, validator agents, and output evaluation systems.\n\n\n# üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.10 or higher\n- Access to OpenAI or Anthropic API keys (Azure and Bedrock Supported)\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\npip install upsonic\n\n```\n\n\n\n# Basic Example\n\nSet your OPENAI_API_KEY\n\n```console\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***\n```\n\nStart the agent \n\n```python\nfrom upsonic import Task, Agent\n\ntask = Task(\"Who developed you?\")\n\nagent = Agent(name=\"Coder\")\n\nagent.print_do(task)\n```\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n# Why Choose Upsonic?\nUpsonic is a next-generation framework that makes agents production-ready by solving three critical challenges:\n\n1- **Reliability**: While other frameworks require expertise and complex coding for reliability features, Upsonic offers easy-to-activate reliability layers without disrupting functionality.\n\n2- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: The MCP allows you to leverage tools with various functionalities developed both officially and by third parties without requiring you to build custom tools from scratch.\n\n3- **Integrated Browser Use and Computer Use**: Directly use and deploy agents that works on non-API systems.\n\n4- **Secure Runtime**: Isolated environment to run agents\n\n![sdk-server](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b276199-ae60-4221-b8e6-b266443a3641)\n\n<br>\n\n## üìä Reliability Layer\n\nLLM output reliability is critical, particularly for numerical operations and action execution. Upsonic addresses this through a multi-layered reliability system, enabling control agents and verification rounds to ensure output accuracy.\n\n**Verifier Agent**: Validates outputs, tasks, and formats - detecting inconsistencies, numerical errors, and hallucinations\n\n**Editor Agent**: Works with verifier feedback to revise and refine outputs until they meet quality standards\n\n**Rounds**: Implements iterative quality improvement through scored verification cycles\n\n**Loops**: Ensures accuracy through controlled feedback loops at critical reliability checkpoints\n\n\nUpsonic is a reliability-focused framework. The results in the table were generated with a small dataset. They show success rates in the transformation of JSON keys. No hard-coded changes were made to the frameworks during testing; only the existing features of each framework were activated and run. GPT-4o was used in the tests.\n\n10 transfers were performed for each section. The numbers show the error count. So if it says 7, it means 7 out of 10 were done **incorrectly**. The table has been created based on initial results. We are expanding the dataset. The tests will become more reliable after creating a larger test set. Reliability benchmark [repo](https://github.com/Upsonic/Reliability-Benchmark)\n\n\n```python\nclass ReliabilityLayer:\n  prevent_hallucination = 10\n\nagent = Agent(name=\"Coder\", reliability_layer=ReliabilityLayer, model=\"openai/gpt4o\")\n```\n\n<br>\n\n\n**Key features:**\n\n- **Production-Ready Scalability**: Deploy seamlessly on AWS, GCP, or locally using Docker.\n- **Task-Centric Design**: Focus on practical task execution, with options for:\n    - Basic tasks via LLM calls.\n    - Advanced tasks with V1 agents.\n    - Complex automation using V2 agents with MCP integration.\n- **MCP Server Support**: Utilize multi-client processing for high-performance tasks.\n- **Tool-Calling Server**: Exception-secure tool management with robust server API interactions.\n- **Computer Use Integration**: Execute human-like tasks using Anthropic‚Äôs ‚ÄòComputer Use‚Äô capabilities.\n- **Easily adding tools:**¬†You can add your custom tools and MCP tools with a single line of code.\n<br>\n\n# üìô Documentation\n\nYou can access our documentation at [docs.upsonic.ai](https://docs.upsonic.ai/) All concepts and examples are available there.\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tool Integration via MCP\n\nUpsonic officially supports [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) and custom tools. You can use hundreds of MCP servers at [glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers) or [mcprun](https://mcp.run) We also support Python functions inside a class as a tool. You can easily generate your integrations with that.\n\n```python\nfrom upsonic import Agent, Task\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\n# Define Fetch MCP configuration\nclass FetchMCP:\n    command = \"uvx\"\n    args = [\"mcp-server-fetch\"]\n\n# Create response format for web content\nclass WebContent(BaseModel):\n    title: str\n    content: str\n    summary: str\n    word_count: int\n\n# Initialize agent\nweb_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"Web Content Analyzer\",\n    model=\"openai/gpt-4o\",  # You can use other models\n)\n\n# Create a task to analyze a web page\ntask = Task(\n    description=\"Fetch and analyze the content from url. Extract the main content, title, and create a brief summary.\",\n    context=[\"https://upsonic.ai\"],\n    tools=[FetchMCP],\n    response_format=WebContent\n)\n    \n# Usage\nresult = web_agent.print_do(task)\nprint(result.title)\nprint(result.summary)\n\n```\n<br>\n\n\n\n## Direct LLM Call\n\nDirect LLM calls offer faster, cheaper solutions for simple tasks. In Upsonic, you can make calls to model providers without any abstraction level and organize structured outputs. You can also use tools with LLM calls.\n\n```python\nfrom upsonic import Task, Direct\n\ndirect = Direct(model=\"openai/gpt-4o\")\n\ntask = Task(\"Where can I use agents in real life?\")\n\ndirect.print_do(task)\n\n```\n\n<br>\n\n## Cookbook\nYou can [check out many examples](https://github.com/Upsonic/cookbook) showing how to build agents using MCP tools and browser use with Upsonic.\n\n<br>\n\n## Telemetry\n\nWe use anonymous telemetry to collect usage data. We do this to focus our developments on more accurate points. You can disable it by setting the UPSONIC_TELEMETRY environment variable to false.\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"UPSONIC_TELEMETRY\"] = \"False\"\n```\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n\n"
