These servers extend Claude's capabilities by providing access to specific biomedical databases.\n\n## Available Servers\n\nThis repository contains the following MCP servers:\n\n### PubMed MCP Server\nAccess the PubMed database of biomedical literature.\n- Search PubMed for articles matching a query\n- Retrieve abstracts for specific articles\n- Find related articles based on a PMID\n- Search for articles by a specific author\n\n### BioRxiv/MedRxiv MCP Server\nAccess preprints from bioRxiv and medRxiv repositories.\n- Get detailed information about preprints by DOI\n- Find published versions of preprints\n- Search for recent preprints\n- Search preprints by date range and category\n\n### ClinicalTrials.gov MCP Server\nAccess information about clinical trials.\n- Search for trials matching specific criteria\n- Get detailed information about specific trials\n- Find trials by medical condition\n- Find trials by location\n\n### DrugBank MCP Server\nAccess drug information from DrugBank.\n- Search for drugs by name\n- Get detailed information about specific drugs\n- Find drugs by indication\n- Find drugs by category\n- Get drug interaction information\n\n### OpenTargets MCP Server\nAccess drug target information from Open Targets.\n- Search for gene targets\n- Get detailed target information\n- Search for diseases\n- Find disease-target associations\n- Search for drugs\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Install dependencies for all servers:\n   ```\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n2. For specific servers, additional setup may be required:\n   - For PubMed: Update the `EMAIL` constant in `pubmed_mcp.py` with your email address (required by NCBI)\n   - For DrugBank: Add your DrugBank API key to the `API_KEY` constant in `drugbank_mcp.py`\n\n3. Run a server:\n   ```\n   python pubmed_mcp.py  # Replace with the server you want to run\n   ```\n\n## Connecting to Claude for Desktop\n\nTo use these servers with Claude for Desktop:\n\n1. Make sure you have the latest version of Claude for Desktop installed.\n2. Edit your Claude for Desktop configuration file located at:\n   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n   - Windows: `%AppData%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n3. Add server configurations:\n   ```json\n   {\n       \"mcpServers\": {\n           \"pubmed-mcp\": {\n               \"command\": \"python\",\n               \"args\": [\n                   \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/pubmed_mcp.py\"\n               ]\n           },\n           \"biorxiv-mcp\": {\n               \"command\": \"python\",\n               \"args\": [\n                   \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/bioarxiv_mcp.py\"\n               ]\n           },\n           \"clinicaltrials-mcp\": {\n               \"command\": \"python\",\n               \"args\": [\n                   \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/clinicaltrialsgov_mcp.py\"\n               ]\n           },\n           \"drugbank-mcp\": {\n               \"command\": \"python\",\n               \"args\": [\n                   \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/drugbank_mcp.py\"\n               ]\n           },\n           \"opentargets-mcp\": {\n               \"command\": \"python\",\n               \"args\": [\n                   \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/opentargets_mcp.py\"\n               ]\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   Replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/` with the absolute path to each script on your system.\n\n4. Restart Claude for Desktop.\n\n## Example Queries\n\n- \"Find recent research on CRISPR therapy for cancer\"\n- \"Get me the abstract for PMID 34567890\"\n- \"What preprints were published last week on COVID-19?\"\n- \"What clinical trials are currently recruiting for Alzheimer's disease?\"\n- \"Find information about the drug metformin\"\n- \"What targets are associated with Parkinson's disease?\"\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues:\n\n1. Check that you've properly configured the server\n2. Make sure you've restarted Claude for Desktop after updating the configuration\n3. Check Claude's logs for errors:\n   - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`\n   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\logs\\mcp*.log`"
