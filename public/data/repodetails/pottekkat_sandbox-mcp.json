  "readme": "![Sandbox MCP Logo](readme-banner.png)\n\n![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/pottekkat/sandbox-mcp/release.yaml)\n![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/pottekkat/sandbox-mcp)\n![GitHub commits since latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/pottekkat/sandbox-mcp/latest)\n![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/pottekkat/sandbox-mcp)\n\n**Sandbox MCP** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables LLMs (MCP hosts/clients) to **run code in secure, isolated Docker containers**.\n\nWhile LLMs are really good at generating code, most **can't run the code they generate**. You end up running this untested code directly on your machine, which could have drastic unintended consequences.\n\nGiving LLMs the tools to test the code safely prevents such issues and helps you **generate more accurate code in fewer iterations**.\n\nSandbox MCP gives the LLMs an **easy-to-use execution environment that anyone can create and configure** through a simple, AI-native MCP server that runs locally.\n\n_Inspired by [Codapi](https://codapi.org). Some sandboxes are the same as [Codapi sandboxes](https://github.com/nalgeon/sandboxes)._\n\n## Use Cases\n\nSandbox MCP can be used for many different tasks, including but not limited to:\n\n- **Secure code execution**: Run any code generated by an LLM in a secure, isolated environment, protecting your system from untrusted or potentially harmful code.\n- **Code testing**: Automatically test and validate code in various languages and or configurations in various environments before integrating it into larger projects or production systems.\n- **User code validation**: Safely execute and check user-submitted code or scripts, ensuring they behave as expected and do not perform malicious actions.\n- **Network troubleshooting**: Diagnose connectivity issues, test endpoints, and analyze network performance using isolated network tools, all without exposing your system.\n- **Educational and interview coding**: Instantly compile and run code snippets for learning, teaching, or technical interviews, providing immediate feedback in a safe, temporary environment.\n- **Automated code review and feedback**: Enable LLMs to execute, test, and review code automatically, offering actionable feedback or suggestions before code is merged or deployed.\n\n## Demo\n\nThis demo shows how Sandbox MCP works with Claude Desktop.\n\n![Sandbox MCP demo GIF](demo.gif)\n\nTry the [video](demo.mp4) if the GIF isn't clear.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Download Binary\n\nYou can download the appropriate binary for your operating system (for example, `Darwin`) and processor architecture (`arm64`) from the [Releases page](https://github.com/pottekkat/sandbox-mcp/releases) (`sandbox-mcp_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz`).\n\n### Install via Go\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n- Go 1.24 or higher\n\n```bash\ngo install github.com/pottekkat/sandbox-mcp/cmd/sandbox-mcp@latest\n```\n\nGet the path to the `sandbox-mcp` binary:\n\n```bash\nwhich sandbox-mcp\n```\n\n### Build from Source\n\nSee the [Development section](#development).\n\n## Usage\n\n### Initilization\n\nBefore you use `sandbox-mcp` with LLMs, you need to initialize its configuration:\n\n```bash\n# Create the configuration directory in\n# $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sandbox-mcp and pull\n# the default sandboxes from GitHub\nsandbox-mcp --pull\n\n# Build the Docker images for the sandboxes\nsandbox-mcp --build\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Make sure you have Docker installed and running.\n\n### With MCP Hosts/Clients\n\nAdd this to your `claude_desktop_config.json` for Claude Desktop or `mcp.json` for Cursor IDE:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"sandbox-mcp\": {\n            \"command\": \"path/to/sandbox-mcp\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"--stdio\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Make sure to replace `path/to/sandbox-mcp` with the actual path to the `sandbox-mcp` binary.\n\n## Available Sandboxes\n\n| Sandbox | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| [shell](/sandboxes/shell) | A secure, isolated Linux environment for running lightweight commands that does not require network access. |\n| [python](/sandboxes/python) | Safely execute Python code in a secure, isolated environment. |\n| [rust](/sandboxes/rust) | Compile and run Rust code in an isolated environment. |\n| [network-tools](/sandboxes/network-tools) | Use various network utilities in an isolated Linux sandbox. Perfect for network diagnostics and troubleshooting. See https://github.com/jonlabelle/docker-network-tools for a list of available tools. |\n| [go](/sandboxes/go) | Run Go code securely in an isolated environment with network access. |\n| [javascript](/sandboxes/javascript) | Run JavaScript code in an isolated environment using Node.js. |\n| [apisix](/sandboxes/apisix) | Run a lightweight instance of Apache APISIX, which can be configured through a YAML file and can be interacted through the curl command provided in the main.sh file. For example, curl -sI `http://127.0.0.1:9080/ip`. |\n| [java](/sandboxes/java) | Compile and run Java code in an isolated sandbox. Supports Java preview features. |\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> ### Your Own Sandbox\n> \n> You can create and add your own sandboxes in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sandbox-mcp/sandboxes`. A sandbox is essentially a Dockerfile and a JSON configuration. Check out the [examples and the guide](/sandboxes) to learn more.\n\n## Development\n\nFork and clone the repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/username/sandbox-mcp.git\n```\n\nChange into the directory:\n\n```bash\ncd sandbox-mcp\n```\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```bash\nmake deps\n```\n\nBuild the project:\n\n```bash\nmake build\n```\n\nUpdate your MCP servers configuration to point to the local build:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"sandbox-mcp\": {\n            \"command\": \"/path/to/sandbox-mcp/dist/sandbox-mcp\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"--stdio\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](LICENSE)\n"
