Ships with full Google Chat support.</h3>\n  \n  <p>\n    <strong>Keywords:</strong> Google Chat MCP • MCP Server Implementation • AI Chat Integration • Google Workspace Automation • Team Collaboration AI\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 What is Google Chat MCP Server?\n\n**Google Chat MCP Server** is an open-source, production-ready **Model Control Protocol (MCP) server** designed for **Google Chat integration with AI assistants**. Built with an extensible **multi-provider architecture**, this project provides a robust foundation for integrating AI assistants with team chat platforms.\n\n### 🏢 Built for Organizational Security & Privacy\n\n**Important Security Note:** This tool is **designed for local, organizational use only**. We strongly recommend using this with **organization-provided on-premises LLM instances or your local installed LLM Agent Model** rather than cloud-based LLM model's to maintain complete control over your team's chat data and communications.\n\n**Why Local/On-Premises Deployment:**\n- **Data Privacy**: Keep sensitive team conversations within your organization\n- **Security Compliance**: Meet enterprise security and compliance requirements\n- **Full Control**: Maintain complete oversight of data flow and access\n- **Custom Policies**: Implement organization-specific security measures\n\nWhile anyone can adapt this tool for their particular use cases, it's designed with enterprise security as a priority.\n\n### Current Implementation Status\n\n- ✅ **Google Chat Provider** - **Production Ready** with comprehensive API coverage\n- 🔄 **Slack Provider** - Planned (contributions welcome)\n- 📝 **Microsoft Teams Provider** - Planned (contributions welcome)\n\n**Key Capability**: All providers can run simultaneously with a unified interface, allowing your AI assistant to seamlessly work across multiple chat platforms at once. [Learn more](#step-4-running-multiple-chat-providers-simultaneously) about this powerful feature.\n\n### 🧭 The Story Behind This Project\n\n> *We even see open-source MCP servers for Google Chat — but not sure about Microsoft Teams or Slack, officially or in open source. However, even the ones that do exist fall short in real-world applicability. They offer limited functionalities that cannot handle full-context workflows like this project demonstrates.*\n\nThis **multi-provider MCP framework** was born from a real frustration experienced by development teams trying to leverage AI assistants in their daily workflows.\n\n---\n\n#### **The Original Problem**\n\nPicture this scenario: You're debugging a complex issue, your AI assistant suggests a solution, but you need to check if your teammates have encountered something similar. You switch to Google Chat, scroll through hundreds of messages, copy-paste error logs, wait for responses, then manually relay the solution back to your AI assistant.\n\nThis constant context-switching was breaking the flow of productive AI-assisted development.\n\n---\n\n#### **The Breaking Point**\n\nDuring a critical production incident, a developer spent 30 minutes manually shuttling information between Claude (via Cursor) and the team's Google Chat space. The AI had the technical knowledge to help. The team had the contextual experience.\nBut there was no bridge connecting these two knowledge sources.\n\nThat's when we realized:\n\n> **AI assistants need to be participants in team collaboration — not isolated tools.**\n\n**Our Solution:**\n- **Seamless Integration**: AI assistants become active participants in team chat\n- **Contextual Awareness**: AI can search team history for similar issues and solutions\n- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: AI can share problems with the team and implement their suggestions\n- **Knowledge Bridging**: Connect AI technical knowledge with team experiential knowledge\n\n## 🎯 Built for Developer Extensibility\n\n### 🏗️ Modular Provider Architecture\n\nEach chat platform is implemented as an independent module:\n\n```\nsrc/providers/\n├── google_chat/     # ✅ Complete implementation\n├── slack/           # 📋 Framework ready for implementation  \n└── teams/           # 📋 Framework ready for implementation\n```\n\n\n### 👥 Who's This For?\n\nThis project is designed for **two primary audiences**:\n\n#### 🛠️ 1. Developers inside organizations\n\nIf you're a developer working in a team that uses **Google Chat**, and you're looking to integrate your **AI IDEs (like Cursor, CodeWhisperer, or Copilot Chat)** with team conversations — this MCP client will save you hours.\nNo more manually copying logs, checking for context, or waiting for someone to see your question.\nYour AI agent can now directly:\n\n* Search your chat history for relevant past discussions\n* Share code snippets or error logs automatically\n* Receive responses and convert them into actionable fixes\n* Summarize ongoing team activities\n* Fetch missing config/scripts from shared spaces\n\n#### 💡 2. Open source contributors & AI platform builders\n\nIf you're building AI-powered tools, IDE integrations, or internal assistants — this is your starting point for a **multi-provider MCP architecture**.\nYou can fork this project to:\n\n* Extend support for **Slack**, **Microsoft Teams**, or **custom messaging platforms**\n* Build your own custom AI workflows on top of MCP\n\n\n## 🧩 Google Chat MCP Server – Real-world Usage Showcase\n\nThese walkthroughs show how an AI assistant, powered by this MCP server, evolves from a passive tool into an active collaborator — debugging issues, coordinating teams, syncing scripts, and proactively unblocking developers.\n\n---\n\n### 🛠️ Tool Setup & Initialization\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img
