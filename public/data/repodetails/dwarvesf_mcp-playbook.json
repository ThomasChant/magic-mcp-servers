The exact `command` and `args` will depend on how you choose to run the server (e.g., directly via `node` or using Docker).\n\nFirst, ensure that you add this prompt to your cursor rules, cline rules, or windsurf rules:\n\n```\nALWAYS run the `init_playbook` tool before starting to get instructions on how things should be done and documented.\n```\n\nThen, add the following configuration to your MCP client:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-playbook\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@dwarvesf/mcp-playbook@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"your_github_token_here\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nConsult the Claude Desktop documentation for detailed instructions on configuring MCP servers.\n\n## How the MCP works behind the scenes\n\nThe MCP Playbook server operates by receiving tool call requests from an MCP client (like Claude Desktop). These requests are processed in the `src/index.ts` file, which acts as the server's entry point.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[MCP Client] --> B[\"CallToolRequestSchema\"];\n    A --> E[\"ListToolsRequestSchema\"];\n    A --> F[\"ListPromptsRequestSchema\"];\n    A --> G[\"GetPromptRequestSchema\"];\n\n    subgraph src/index.ts\n        B\n        E\n        F\n        G\n    end\n\n    B --> C[\"Switch Case (toolName)\"];\n\n    subgraph src/tools/\n        C --> C1(\"init_playbook\");\n        C --> C2(\"create_adr\");\n        C --> C3(\"search_runbook\");\n        C --> C4(\"... ... ...\");\n    end\n\n    C1 --> D1(\"handleInitPlaybook\");\n    C2 --> D2(\"handleCreateAdr\");\n    C3 --> D3(\"handleSearchRunbook\");\n    C4 --> D4(\"... ... ...\");\n\n    E --> D12(\"toolDefinitions\");\n    F --> D13(\"handleListPrompts\");\n    G --> D14(\"handleGetPrompt\");\n\n    subgraph src/handlers/\n        D1\n        D2\n        D3\n        D4\n        D12\n        D13\n        D14\n    end\n```\n\n1.  **Tool Call Request:** An MCP client sends a `CallToolRequest` to the server, specifying the `toolName` and any necessary `arguments`.\n2.  **Request Handling:** The `src/index.ts` file has a request handler set up for `CallToolRequest` using `server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request: CallToolRequest) => { ... })`.\n3.  **Tool Routing (Switch Case):** Inside the request handler, a `switch` statement on the `toolName` routes the request to the appropriate handler function.\n4.  **Handler Execution:** Each case in the `switch` statement calls a dedicated handler function (e.g., `handleCreateSpec`, `handleSearchRunbook`, `handleSyncPrompt`) located in the `src/handlers.ts` file. These handlers contain the specific logic for each tool.\n5.  **Result:** The handler function performs the requested action and returns a result. This result is then sent back to the MCP client.\n\nThis flow ensures that each tool call is directed to the correct logic for execution, allowing the server to perform various documentation and utility tasks.\n\n## Available Tools\n\n| Tool Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `init_playbook`            | Provides an instruction to the LLM about the purpose of the mcp-playbook server, which is to facilitate local project documentation and enable partial replication of documentation and chat logs for an AI-powered playbook.                                                                                                                                                  |\n| `create_spec`              | Creates or overwrites a new specification file (e.g., PRD, RFC, architectural planning) in the docs/specs/ directory of the target project.

Its primary functions are to help LLMs structure documentation within a designated project directory and to save/upload conversation histories. Unlike tools that might rely on external `commander` or `github` environments, this server implements file system operations and GitHub API interactions directly using Node.js's built-in modules (`fs`, `path`, `https`) and libraries like `node-fetch`.\n\nThe server operates on a `target_project_dir` specified by the LLM, managing files and directories within that location. It does _not_ store documentation or chat logs within its own repository structure.\n\n### Data Flow and Interaction\n\nThe interaction between the AI conversation, file exploration, the LLM, the `mcp-playbook` server, and the GitHub repositories can be visualized as follows:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[LLM] --> B(\"AI Conversation\")\n    B --> C{Explore Files}\n    C -->|Files with Prompts| D(\"Prompts in Files\")\n    C -->|Files without Prompts| B\n    B -->|Provides Context| F(\"MCP Playbook Server\")\n    D -->|Provides Context| F\n    F -->|suggest_runbook| G[\"dwarvesf/runbook (Practices/Specs)\"]\n    F -->|save_and_upload_chat_log| H[\"dwarvesf/prompt-log (Conversation Logs)\"]\n    F -->|sync_prompt| I[\"dwarvesf/prompt-db (Synced Prompts)\"]\n```\n\nThis diagram illustrates how the AI conversation and the prompts found during file exploration provide context to the MCP Playbook server. The server then executes the `suggest_runbook`, `save_and_upload_chat_log`, and `sync_prompt` tools to interact with the respective GitHub repositories.\n\n## Tool Details\n\n### `init_playbook`\n\nProvides an instruction to the LLM about the purpose of the mcp-playbook server, which is to facilitate local project documentation and enable partial replication of documentation and chat logs for an AI-powered playbook.\n\n**Parameters:**\nNone.\n\n**Returns:**\nA JSON object containing the instruction.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instruction\": \"string\" // Instruction for the LLM regarding the purpose of the mcp-playbook.\n}\n```\n\n### `create_spec`\n\nCreates or overwrites a new specification file (e.g., PRD, RFC, architectural planning) in the `docs/specs/` directory of the target project. Specification files will be named following a `spec-name.md` convention with sequence numbering (e.g., `0001-initial-design.md`).\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `target_project_dir` (string, required): The absolute or relative path to the root of the target project directory.\n- `spec_name` (string, required): The name of the specification file (without sequence numbers and the `.md` extension). Basic sanitization is applied.\n- `content` (string, required): The markdown content of the specification.\n\n**Returns:**\nA JSON object indicating success or failure, including the path if successful.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\" | \"error\",\n  \"path\": \"string\" | undefined, // Path to the created file if successful\n  \"message\": \"string\" // Description of the result or error\n}\n```\n\n### `create_adr`\n\nCreates or overwrites a new Architectural Decision Record (ADR) file in the `docs/adr/` directory of the target project. ADR files will be named following an `adr-name.md` convention with sequence numbering (e.g., `0001-use-react.md`).\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `target_project_dir` (string, required): The absolute path to the root of the target project directory. Using an absolute path is highly recommended for reliability.\n- `adr_name` (string, required): The name of the ADR file (without sequence numbers and the `.md` extension). Basic sanitization is applied.\n- `content` (string, required): The markdown content of the ADR.\n\n**Returns:**\nA JSON object indicating success or failure, including the path if successful.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\" | \"error\",\n  \"path\": \"string\" | undefined, // Path to the created file if successful\n  \"message\": \"string\" // Description of the result or error\n}\n```\n\n### `create_changelog`\n\nCreates a new, detailed, and user-facing changelog entry file in the `docs/changelog/` directory of the target project. Each changelog entry will be a separate file named following a `changelog-entry.md` convention with sequence numbering (e.g., `0001-added-new-feature.md`). Entries should provide comprehensive information about changes, including how to use new features or any impact on existing functionality, rather than being brief summaries.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `target_project_dir` (string, required): The absolute path to the root of the target project directory. Using an absolute path is highly recommended for reliability.\n- `entry_content` (string, required): The markdown content of the new changelog entry.\n- `changelog_name` (string, required): The desired name for the changelog file (without sequence numbers and the `.md` extension).\n\n**Returns:**\nA JSON object indicating success or failure, including the path if successful.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\" | \"error\",\n  \"path\": \"string\" | undefined, // Path to the updated file if successful\n  \"message\": \"string\" // Description of the result or error\n}\n```\n\n### `distill_project_runbook`\n\nCreates or updates the central `docs/runbook.md` file within the target project. The LLM is responsible for:\n\n1. Thoroughly analyzing all relevant project documents (ADRs, specs, changelogs, code, etc.) within the `target_project_dir`.\n2. If `docs/runbook.md` already exists, reviewing its current content as part of the analysis.\n3. Synthesizing all gathered information (including from any existing `docs/runbook.md`) into an updated and comprehensive Project Runbook.\n\nThe tool takes the LLM-generated content and saves it to `docs/runbook.md`, overwriting the previous version. The frontmatter (title, last_updated, distilled_from) is managed by the tool.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `target_project_dir` (string, required): The absolute path to the root of the target project directory.\n- `content` (string, required): The complete markdown content for the `docs/runbook.md` file, as generated and synthesized by the LLM.\n- `source_document_references` (array of strings, optional): An array of paths or descriptive references to the key source documents the LLM used for the latest distillation/update (e.g., `[\\'docs/adr/0001-auth-decision.md\\', \\'src/auth/service.ts\\']`).\n\n**Returns:**\nA JSON object indicating success or failure, including the path to `docs/runbook.md` if successful.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\" | \"error\",\n  \"path\": \"string\" | undefined, // Path to docs/runbook.md if successful\n  \"message\": \"string\" // Description of the result or error\n}\n```\n\n### `save_and_upload_chat_log`\n\nCaptures the current conversation history. If the MCP client provides the history directly, it's used. Otherwise, the server attempts to parse chat logs from locally installed supported editors (Cursor, Zed, Cline) based on the optional `editorType` parameter or by trying each parser. The captured/parsed history is then saved as a uniquely named markdown file in the `.chat/` directory of the target project and uploaded to the `dwarvesf/prompt-log` GitHub repository. Requires a `userId` for organizing logs.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `target_project_dir` (string, required): The absolute path to the root of the target project directory where the chat log should be saved locally before uploading. Using an absolute path is highly recommended for reliability.\n- `userId` (string, required): The unique ID of the user/LLM client (e.g., your GitHub username).\n- `editorType` (string, optional): Specifies the editor (e.g., 'cursor', 'zed', 'cline') from which to attempt parsing chat history if not directly provided by the client.

It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the repository, but just log the thought. Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed. For example, if you explore the repo and discover the source of a bug, call this tool to brainstorm several unique ways of fixing the bug, and assess which change(s) are likely to be simplest and most effective. Alternatively, if you receive some test results, call this tool to brainstorm ways to fix the failing tests.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `thought` (string, required): Your thoughts.\n\n**Returns:**\nA JSON object containing the thought that was processed. The server wraps the raw string returned by the handler.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"content\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"\\\"Your processed thought here\\\"\" // Note: The thought string itself will be JSON stringified\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nOr, if an error occurs:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"isError\": true,\n  \"content\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"Error: Invalid arguments: Your error message\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Setup\n\n### Local Development\n\n1.  Clone the repository:\n    ```bash\n    git clone git@github.com:dwarvesf/mcp-playbook.git\n    cd mcp-playbook\n    ```\n2.  Install dependencies:\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n3.  Build the project:\n    ```bash\n    npm run build # This compiles TypeScript to JavaScript in the 'dist' directory\n    ```\n4.  Configure GitHub Authentication (see Configuration section below).\n5.  Run the compiled server:\n    ```bash\n    node dist/src/index.js\n    ```\n\n### Running with Docker (Optional)\n\nA `Dockerfile` is included in the plan but not fully implemented here. Once completed, you can build and run the Docker image:\n\n1.  Build the Docker image:\n    ```bash\n    docker build -t mcp-playbook .\n    ```\n2.  Run the container, ensuring the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable is passed:\n    ```bash\n    docker run --pull=always -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=\"your_token\" mcp-playbook\n    ```\n\n## Configuration and testing\n\nThe `save_and_upload_chat_log` tool requires a GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope to upload files to `dwarvesf/prompt-log`. This token must be provided via the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.\n\nFor local development, you can use a `.env` file in the project root:\n\n```dotenv\nGITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_github_token_here\n```\n\nEnsure `.env` is added to your `.gitignore` file.\n\n### Testing\n\nRun `npm run build` and update your MCP config to direct it to the output `index.js` file.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-playbook\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/your/mcp-playbook/dist/src/index.js\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"your_github_token_here\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Example\n\n```\nmcp_mcp-playbook_create_spec(target_project_dir=\"/Users/monotykamary/VCS/working-remote/my-new-project\", spec_name=\"Initial Design\", content=\"# Initial Design Specification\\n\\nThis document outlines the initial design of the project...\")\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Environment Variable Not Set**: Ensure the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable is correctly set in the environment where the `mcp-playbook` server process is running.\n- **File/Directory Not Found**: The server operates within the specified `target_project_dir`. Ensure the path provided exists and is accessible by the server process. File system errors (`ENOENT`) often indicate an incorrect path or missing directory.\n- **GitHub API Errors**: If `save_and_upload_chat_log` fails, check the server logs for details from the `githubApi.ts` error handling. Common issues include incorrect tokens, insufficient permissions, or rate limiting.\n\n## Handoff Guidance for Another Engineer\n\n- **Self-Contained Implementation:** This server uses direct Node.js `fs` and `node-fetch` for file system and GitHub API interactions, _not_ external `commander` or `github` tools provided by the environment.\n- **`target_project_dir`:** All tools interacting with user files require and operate within the `target_project_dir`. Input validation for this path is crucial for security.\n- **Dependencies:** Ensure all `npm` dependencies are installed (`npm install`). The project uses TypeScript; compile with `npm run build` (or `npx tsc`).\n- **Authentication:** GitHub authentication relies solely on the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable read by `process.env` in `src/githubApi.ts`.\n- **Conversation History Placeholder:** The `getConversationHistoryPlaceholder()` function in `src/handlers.ts` is a _dummy implementation_. It _must_ be replaced with logic to retrieve actual conversation history from the MCP framework hosting this server for the `save_and_upload_chat_log` tool to work correctly.\n- **MCP Framework Integration:** The handler functions in `src/handlers.ts` are designed to be called by an external MCP framework that receives and routes tool calls from the LLM. The `src/index.ts` file is the conceptual entry point for this integration.\n"
