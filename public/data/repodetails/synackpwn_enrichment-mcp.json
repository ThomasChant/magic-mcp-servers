  "readme": "# Enrichment MCP Server\n\nA Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for performing enrichment given a provided observable. The combination of configured services and the provided observable(s) will determine which enrichment services to utilize. \n\nThis tool provides a simple implementation to perform third-party enrichment using common services (e.g. VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, etc.).\n\n> This project is has not been used in any production setting.\n\n## Features\n\nThis implementation of the `enrichment-mcp` MCP server exposes the following [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools).\n\n* observable-lookup - A generic endpoint which examines and routes the given observable to the correct tool.\n* lookup-ipaddress - Performs enrichment on a given IPv4 address.\n* lookup-domain - Performs enrichment on a given domain name.\n* lookup-url - Performs enrichment on a given URL (and in some cases domain name).\n* lookup-email - Performs enrichment of a given email address.\n\n> If you encounter an issue with the determined observable type, then please create an issue or I can update the current implemented regex patterns.\n\n### Supported Services\n\nThe following services and observable types are currently supported:\n\n> If you have any suggestions or believe another service should be implemented, please create an issue or pull request!\n\n| Name | API Key Required | Supports IP | Supports Domain | Supports URL | Supports Email |\n|------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|\n| VirusTotal | Yes        | Yes         | Yes             | Yes          | No             |\n| HybridAnalysis | Yes    | Yes         | Yes             | Yes          | No             |\n| AlienVault | Yes        | Yes         | Yes             | Yes          | No             |\n| Shodan     | Yes        | Yes         | Yes             | Yes          | No             |\n| Urlscan.io | Yes        | Yes         | Yes             | Yes          | No             |\n| AbuseIPDB  | Yes        | Yes         | No              | No           | No             |\n| HaveIBeenPwned | Yes    | No          | No              | No           | Yes            |\n\n## Requirements\n\nThis MCP service implements a custom config file that is used to determine which third-party enrichment services should be used for observable lookups.\n\nSince this is purely for development / testing at this current time, the easiest way to run this on a local mac/system is:\n\n```bash\nuv run --env-file .env server.py\n```\n\nThis requires that you use the provided template [.env.exampl](.env.example) and create a new `.env` file with your secrets.\n\n### config.yaml\n\nThis project provides a custom configuration file and I believe it's pretty easy to understand.\n\nFirst, copy the provided [config.yaml.example](config.yaml.example) config and remove the `.example` extension before using this service.\n\nWithin this configuration file there are two main sections of data; [server](#server-configuration) and [enrichments](#enrichments-configuration).\n\nBy default, all services supported are mapped to the current implemented enrichment action types. Currently, the only true enrichment action type is `lookups` but other may be implemented in the future.\n\nUnder the `lookups` we have the different supported enrichment types.\n\nThat being said, each individual service can have a key named `apikey` and the API key value from that service but please consider not doing so.\n\nYou can set this keys value directly in the [config.yaml.example](config.yaml.example) but the preferred way is to use a `.env`.\n\n> NOTE: It is highly recommended to set secrets as environmental variables when implementing this service. Stop storing secrets silly goose.\n\nIn order for this service to discover these variables, they must be in a specific format. Below is the list of currently supported variables:\n\n* ENRICHMENT_MCP_VIRUSTOTAL_KEY\n* ENRICHMENT_MCP_HYBRIDANALYSIS_KEY\n* ENRICHMENT_MCP_ALIENVAULT_KEY\n* ENRICHMENT_MCP_SHODAN_KEY\n* ENRICHMENT_MCP_URLSCAN_KEY\n* ENRICHMENT_MCP_HIBP_KEY\n\n### Server Configuration\n\nThere are minimal settings here as this is mostly for sandboxing and testing, but these settings typically do not need to be changed or altered for this service to work.\n\n```yaml\nserver:\n  host: 0.0.0.0 # the host address\n  port: 8000 # the port\n  debug: false # whether to enable debug logging\n  log_level: INFO # the default logging level\n```\n\n### Enrichments Configuration\n\nEach enrichment in our config file resides under the `enrichments` key. Additionally, I have broken out the different types of enrichment that can be performed. This means, in the current implementation, we only have a single action type called `lookups` but in the future this can be expanded for things like `scans` or `queries` etc.\n\nUnderneath these high-level actions, we list out the observable type followed by a list of services that support that type. The currently supported observable types are:\n\n* ipaddress - ipv4 addresses\n* domain - A domain or netloc\n* url - A fully qualified URL with schema, etc.\n* email - A standard email address\n\nWe also support these types but they are currently not implemented:\n\n* md5 - A file MD5 hash\n* sha1 - A file SHA1 hash\n* sha256 - A file SHA256 hash\n\nEach service must have a `name` and a `template`. The `apikey` field can be provided but it is recommended to use environmental variables.\n\n### Prompt Templates\n\nEach service and observable type can have it's own template. These reside in the [templates](./templates/) directory and all templates are expected to exist here.\n\nEach service defined has a prompt template using jinja2 templates. You can modify these are needed, but the format of the filename must remain the same. \n\nThese files have the following filename pattern.\n\n```bash\n{service.name}.{enrichment.type}.jinja2\n```\n\nAdditionally, ensure that the response object has the correct fields in the template itself or you will receive an error.\n\nBelow is an example output for a prompt of `Enrich this IP 91.195.240.94` with some errors mixed in:\n\n```python\n{\n    \"virustotal\": \"error occurred looking up ip 91.195.240.94 in virustotal\",\n    \"alienvault\": \"Service: alienvault\\nIPAddress: \\nReputation Score: 0\\nTotal Votes: \",\n    \"shodan\": \"Service: shodan\\nIPAddress: 91.195.240.94\\nLast Analysis Results: 2025-04-25T21:02:52.644602\\n\\nTags\\n\\n\\nAdditional information includes:\\n\\n* Latitude: 48.13743\\n* Longitude: 11.57549\\n* ASN: AS47846\\n* Domains: [\"servervps.net\"]\",\n    \"hybridanalysis\": \"error occurred looking up ip 91.195.240.94 in hybridanalysis\",\n    \"urlscan\": \"Service: urlscan\\nResult: https://urlscan.io/api/v1/result/01966efe-c8fa-74a4-bfc0-1ed479838e85/\\n\\nStats\\n\\n* uniqIPs - 6\\n\\n* uniqCountries - 2\\n\\n* dataLength - 432561\\n\\n* encodedDataLength - 218606\\n\\n* requests - 14\\n\\n\\nPage\\n* country - DE\\n* server - Parking/1.0\\n* ip - 91.195.240.94\\n* mimeType - text/html\\n* title - wearab.org\\xa0-\\xa0Informationen zum Thema wearab.\\n* url - https://login.wearab.org/\\n* tlsValidDays - 364\\n* tlsAgeDays - 0\\n* tlsValidFrom - 2025-04-25T00:00:00.000Z\\n* domain - login.wearab.org\\n* apexDomain - wearab.org\\n* asnname - SEDO-AS SEDO GmbH, DE\\n* asn - AS47846\\n* tlsIssuer - Encryption Everywhere DV TLS CA - G2\\n* status - 200\\n\",\n    \"abuseipdb\": \"Service: abuseripdb\\nIPAddress: 91.195.240.94\\nLast Analysis Result: 2025-03-30T14:04:45+00:00\\nScore: 7\\nUsage: Data Center/Web Hosting/Transit\\nIs Tor: False\\nIs Whitelisted: False\\nISP: Sedo Domain Parking\"\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nFor using a pre-built server, instructions from here: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user\n\n* Download Claude for Desktop\n* Install uv\n```bash\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n* Download this repo and add to Claude for Desktop config\n\t* Claude for Desktop > Settings > Developer > Edit Config\n\n> This will create a configuration file at:\n```bash\nmacOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\nWindows: %APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\nOpen up the configuration file in any text editor. Replace the file contents with this:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"mcpServers\": {\n\t\t\"enrichment-mcp\": {\n\t\t\t\"command\": \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/uv\",\n\t\t\t\"args\": [\n\t\t\t\t\"--directory\",\n\t\t\t\t\"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/CLONED/REPOSITORY/enrichment-mcp\",\n\t\t\t\t\"run\",\n\t\t\t\t\"server.py\"\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n    }\n}\n```\n\n4. Relaunch Claude for Desktop\n\nYou should now see two icons in the chat bar, a hammer which shows the tools available and a connection icon which shows the prompt defined and the input required.\n\n## Design\n\nWhile building this server, I was learning astral [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as well as MCP. I definitely over engineered this but it was fun. I also had future uses for some of this code so I tried to design it with that in mind as well (more to come on that).\n\nAdditionally, I specifically moved to Jinja2 templates as this enables better management of the returned prompts/results and, again, furture use cases as well.\n\nPlease provide any feedback, improvements or feature requests; glad to hear them all.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
