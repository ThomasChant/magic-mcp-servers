  "readme": "# Google Flights MCP Server\n\nA Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that connects your Agents or LLMs to Google Flights data. Access flight information, find the cheapest options, filter by time restrictions, and get Google Flights' best recommendations!\n\n## üåç Overview\n\nThis MCP server provides seamless access to Google Flights data, enabling your AI agents to:\n\n- Retrieve **Comprehensive Flight Info**\n- Find the **Cheapest Available Flights**\n- Filter flights based on **Specific Time Constraints**\n- Get Google Flights' recommended **Best Flights**\n\n<br>\n\n> **Note:** Currently, this tool only does one-ways (if you ask for a round-trip, it'll do two one-ways though!) as I built it as a fun pet project to learn about MCPs.\n>\n> If anyone actually finds this useful or wants me to, I can work on adding Round-Trip and Multi-City functionality!! Just raise a PR or [hit me up](https://sahit-personal-website.vercel.app/)!\n\n## üé• Usage & Demo\n\nJust follow the Quick Start to set this up for Claude Desktop, Cursor, or another MCP Client and just ask away to find out about your desired flight info!!\n\n[Insert Claude Desktop Demo Video]\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Tools\n\n### Available Functions/Tools\n\n1. `get_general_flights_info()`: Retrieve comprehensive flight information for a given route\n\n   - Provides detailed flight details for up to 40 flights\n   - Returns a list of human-readable flight descriptions\n\n2. `get_cheapest_flights()`: Find the most affordable flight options\n\n   - Sorts and returns flights by lowest price\n   - Includes current overall route pricing information\n\n3. `get_best_flights()`: Get Google Flights' top recommended flights\n\n   - Identifies and returns flights marked as \"best\" by Google Flights\n   - Helps users find optimal flight choices\n\n4. `get_time_filtered_flights()`: Filter flights by specific time constraints\n   - Search for flights before or after a target time\n   - Allows precise scheduling preferences\n\n### Input Parameters\n\n#### Required Parameters\n\n- `origin: str` - Origin airport IATA code (e.g., \"ATL\", \"SCL\", \"JFK\")\n\n- `destination: str` - Destination airport IATA code (e.g., \"DTW\", \"ICN\", \"LIR\")\n- `departure_date: str` - Departure date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n#### Optional Parameters\n\n- `trip_type: str` - Trip type, either \"one-way\" or \"round-trip\" (default: \"one-way\")\n\n- `seat: str` - Seat type: \"economy\", \"premium-economy\", \"business\", or \"first\" (default: \"economy\")\n- `adults: int` - Number of adult passengers (default: 1)\n- `children: int` - Number of child passengers (default: 0)\n- `infants_in_seat: int` - Number of infants requiring a seat (default: 0)\n- `infants_on_lap: int` - Number of infants traveling on a lap (default: 0)\n\n#### Additional Parameters for Specific Functions\n\n- `n_flights: int` - Number of flights to return (default: 40, only for `get_general_flights_info()`)\n\n- `state: str` - Time filter state, either \"before\" or \"after\" (only for `get_time_filtered_flights()`)\n- `target_time_str: str` - Target time in HH:MM AM/PM format (only for `get_time_filtered_flights()`)\n\n## ‚ö° Quick Start\n\n\n### Claude Desktop\n\n1. Make sure you have the latest [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) downloaded!\n\n2. Clone This Repo\n\n3. Install `uv` to set up our Python Environment\n\n   #### MacOS\n\n   ```bash\n   # Check if uv is already installed\n   uv --version\n\n   # If not installed\n   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n   ```\n\n   #### Windows\n\n   ```powershell\n   # Check if uv is already installed\n   uv --version\n\n   # If not installed\n   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\"\n   ```\n\n   ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: After installation, you must restart your terminal for the `uv` command to get picked up!\n\n\n4. Add this flights MCP Server to your Claude for Desktop config:\n\n   #### MacOS\n\n   - Navigate to the config file location via Terminal: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n   - OR if you have VSCode adn the Code alias, you can just create/edit using:\n\n   ```bash\n   code ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n   ```\n\n   #### Windows\n\n   - Navigate to the config file location via PowerShell: `%AppData%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n   - OR if you have VSCode adn the Code alias, you can just create/edit using:\n\n   ```powershell\n   code $env:AppData\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json\n   ```\n\n   Note: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/config.json` is a different, unrelated file. Do not edit it.\n\n5. Add this flights MCP Server in the `mcpServers` key:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"flights\": {\n         \"command\": \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/.local/bin/uv\",\n         \"args\": [\n           \"--directory\",\n           \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER\",\n           \"run\",\n           \"flights.py\"\n         ]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Make sure to modify the code to include the Absolute Path for `uv` for the `command` param and for the Absolute Path for the `args` param to this Repo.\n\n    You may need to put the full path to the `uv` executable in the command field. You can get this by running:\n    - `which uv` on MacOS/Linux\n    - `where uv` on Windows\n\n    Example:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"flights\": {\n         \"command\": \"/Users/sahitmamidipaka/.local/bin/uv\",\n         \"args\": [\n           \"--directory\",\n           \"/Users/sahitmamidipaka/Documents/Google-Flights-MCP-Server\",\n           \"run\",\n           \"flights.py\"\n         ]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n\n\n\n\n6. That's it! Open Claude for Desktop and you should see the little MCP Tools icon appear (make sure to re-open the app for updates to take place‚Äîyou'll need to do this whenever you change your `claude_desktop_config.json` file üòä)\n\n<!-- Claude Desktop MCP Tools Icon -->\n<img src=\"./assets/images/claude-mcp-tool.png\" alt=\"Claude Desktop MCP Tools Icon\" />\n\nFor more information, refer to the [Official MCP Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server).\n<br>\n\n### Cursor\n\n1. Open Cursor & Go to Settings\n\n2. Press the MCP Tab on the Left Panel\n\n3. Add a new MCP Server (Choose one):\n\n   #### Project Configuration\n\n   - Create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project directory\n   - Ideal for tools specific to a single project\n\n   #### Global Configuration\n\n   - Create a `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file in your home directory\n   - Makes MCP servers available across all Cursor workspaces\n\n4. Attach the following configuration in the `mcp.json` file:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"flights\": {\n         \"command\": \"uv\",\n         \"args\": [\n           \"--directory\",\n           \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER\",\n           \"run\",\n           \"flights.py\"\n         ]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Make sure to replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER` with the actual path to this repo.\n\n   You may need to put the full path to the `uv` executable in the command field. You can get this by running:\n    - `which uv` on MacOS/Linux\n    - `where uv` on Windows\n\n   Example:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"flights\": {\n         \"command\": \"/Users/sahitmamidipaka/.local/bin/uv\",\n         \"args\": [\n           \"--directory\",\n           \"/Users/sahitmamidipaka/Documents/Google-Flights-MCP-Server\",\n           \"run\",\n           \"flights.py\"\n         ]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n\n<!-- Cursor MCP Image -->\n<img src=\"./assets/images/cursor-mcp.png\" alt=\"Cursor Flights MCP Image\" />\n\nFor more information, refer to the [Official Cursor MCP Documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol).\n\n\n## üöÄ Example Usage\n\n- Show me flight options from Atlanta to Shanghai for Jan 1 2026\n- What are the prices like for flights from Detroit to Atlanta this weekend?\n- I live in New York and want to go to Japan.
