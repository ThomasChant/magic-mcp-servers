  "readme": "# HackerMCP\n\nHackerMCP is a module built for AI assistants to access and utilize common penetration testing and security tools. This module enables AI systems to leverage powerful security tools through a simple interface.\n\n## Currently Supported Tools\n\n- **Nmap**: Network discovery and security auditing\n- **Metasploit Framework**: Penetration testing framework\n\n## Future Goals\n\n- Add support for SQLMap\n- Expand available security tools and capabilities\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the following configuration to your MCP configuration file:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"hackermcp\": {\n            \"command\": \"uv\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"--directory\",\n                \"~/dir/to/hackermcp\",\n                \"run\",\n                \"hacker.py\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nReplace `~/dir/to/hackermcp` with the actual path to the hackermcp directory.\n\n## Environment Setup\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Python 3.8 or higher\n- Nmap installed on your system\n- Metasploit Framework installed on your system\n\n### Virtual Environment Setup\n\n1. Clone the repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/R3verseIN/HackerMCP\n   cd HackerMCP\n   ```\n\n2. Set up a virtual environment using `uv`:\n   ```bash\n   uv venv\n   source .venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n3. Install dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   uv pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n### Installing UV\n\nIf you don't have the `uv` package manager then install it:\n\n```bash\npip3 install uv\n```\n\nOr use curl to download the installation script:\n\n```bash\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n\nIf your system doesn't have curl, you can use wget:\n\n```bash\nwget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n**This tool is provided for educational and legitimate security testing purposes only.**\n\nNo warranty is provided with this software.
