The system is designed to support intelligent context-aware task management with persistent state.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Memory Bank System**: Maintains project context in structured Markdown files.\n- **Context Management**: Provides mechanisms for tracking and updating project context.\n- **Task Management**: Integrated functionality for task tracking and execution.\n- **Plan/Act Modes**: Supports distinct planning and execution workflows.\n- **AI Integration**: Uses Claude AI for intelligent planning and task management.\n- **Persistent State**: Maintains context between sessions for continuous workflow.\n- **MCP SDK Integration**: Uses the official Model Context Protocol TypeScript SDK.\n\n## Core Components\n\n- **Memory Manager**: Centralized component for Memory Bank file operations and validation.\n- **Context Manager**: Manages context information with caching and Memory Bank integration.\n- **Plan/Act Mode Engine**: Controls planning and execution workflows with mode-specific functionality.\n- **Async Operation Manager**: Handles long-running operations with status tracking.\n- **TaskFlow Tools**: Collection of tools for interacting with the system through the MCP protocol.\n\n## Memory Bank Structure\n\nThe Memory Bank consists of core files that maintain project context:\n\n- `projectbrief.md`: Foundation document defining core requirements and goals.\n- `productContext.md`: Why the project exists and how it should work.\n- `activeContext.md`: Current work focus and recent changes.\n- `systemPatterns.md`: System architecture and key technical decisions.\n- `techContext.md`: Technologies used and development setup.\n- `progress.md`: Project status, what works, and what's next.\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### Plan Mode\n\n1. Read Memory Bank files to understand context\n2. Analyze current project state\n3. Develop strategy based on context\n4. Present approach for execution\n5. Update Memory Bank with plan details\n\n### Act Mode\n\n1. Check Memory Bank for relevant context\n2. Update documentation as needed\n3. Execute specific task\n4. Document changes and update Memory Bank\n5. Capture insights from task execution\n\n## Available Tools\n\n### Memory Bank Tools\n- Read, write, and update Memory Bank files\n- Get complete Memory Bank context\n- Update the entire Memory Bank\n\n### Plan-Act Tools\n- Generate project plans\n- Execute tasks\n- Switch between Plan and Act modes\n- Document task insights\n\n### System Tools\n- Get operation status and results\n- Check system status\n- Manage asynchronous operations\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Clone the repository\n2. Create a `.env` file with required variables (see `.env.example`)\n3. Install dependencies with `npm install`\n4. Start the server with `npm start`\n\nFor detailed setup and usage instructions, see the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md).\n\n## Environment Configuration\n\n```\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key\nMODEL=claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\nMAX_TOKENS=64000\nTEMPERATURE=0.2\nMEMORY_BANK_PATH=./memory-bank\nLOG_LEVEL=info\n```\n\n## Using with MCP-compatible clients\n\nTaskFlow Memory Server can be used with clients that support the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Configure your client to connect to the server and use the provided tools for interacting with the Memory Bank and managing tasks.\n\nExample workflow:\n```\nCan you switch to Plan mode and generate a plan for implementing the file system integration?\n```\n\n### Claude for Desktop Integration\n\nTaskFlow Memory Server is compatible with Claude for Desktop. To configure:\n\n1. Navigate to your Claude for Desktop configuration directory\n2. Copy the configuration from `config/claude-desktop.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n       \"mcpServers\": {\n           \"taskflow\": {\n               \"command\": \"node\",\n               \"args\": [\n                   \"C:\\\\PATH\\\\TO\\\\taskflow-memory-server\\\\server.js\"\n               ]\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n3. Update the path in the `args` array to point to your installation of TaskFlow Memory Server\n4. Save the file and restart Claude for Desktop\n5. Select \"taskflow\" as your server in Claude for Desktop\n\nThe TaskFlow Memory Server provides Claude for Desktop with:\n- Persistent memory for context across conversations\n- Task planning and execution workflow\n- Structured knowledge management\n\nCommand examples:\n```\nClaude, can you create a task plan for my project?\nClaude, please update the memory bank with our recent progress\nClaude, retrieve project context from memory bank\n```\n\n## Documentation Updates\n\nMemory Bank files should be updated when:\n\n1. Discovering new project patterns\n2. Implementing significant changes\n3. When context needs clarification\n\nUse the `update_memory_file` tool to update specific Memory Bank files with new information.\n\n## Migration to Official MCP SDK\n\nThis project has been migrated from the third-party FastMCP framework to the official Model Context Protocol (MCP) TypeScript SDK. For details about the migration, see [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md) - Basic setup and usage instructions\n- [Technical Reference](docs/technical-reference.md) - Detailed technical documentation\n- [Migration Guide](MIGRATION.md) - Details about the migration to the official MCP SDK\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.\n"
