Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)\n2. Click \"Create API Key\" in the top right\n3. Copy the generated key and set it as an environment variable:\n\n```bash\nexport GOOGLE_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'\n```\n\n## Running the Applications\n\n### CLI Mode (no MCP server)\n\n```bash\nuv run hippycampus-cli\n```\n\n### MCP Server Mode (SSE)\n\n```bash\nuv run hippycampus-server --transport sse --port 8000\n```\n\n### Langflow Server\n\nEnsure the MCP server is running before starting Langflow.\n\n1. Set the components path environment variable:\n```bash\n# Get your current working directory\npwd\n# Use the output to set the components path\nexport LANGFLOW_COMPONENTS_PATH=\"/output/from/pwd/langflow/components\"\n```\n\n2. Start the Langflow server (add --dev for development mode):\n```bash\nuv run langflow run\n```\n\n3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7860`\n\n### Using Custom Components in Langflow\n\n1. In the Langflow UI, locate the custom components:\n   - OpenApi Service: For loading OpenAPI specifications\n   - Hippycampus MCP Server: For connecting to the MCP server over SSE\n\n2. Configure the components:\n   - OpenApi Service: Use `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIs-guru/unofficial_openapi_specs/master/xkcd.com/1.0.0/openapi.yaml` for testing\n   - MCP Server: Use `http://localhost:8000/sse`\n\nSee the Screencast Demo for a visual guide.\n[Screencast Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki5A7PvRQwQ)\n\n**Note that the official XKCD swagger files contain an error and specify the comic_id field as a number instead of an\ninteger, there is a fixed version in the test folder.**\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- Authentication errors: Check if `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set correctly\n- Missing components in Langflow: Verify `LANGFLOW_COMPONENTS_PATH` points to the correct directory\n- Connection issues: Ensure the MCP server is running before connecting via Langflow\n- If components don't appear in Langflow, try restarting the Langflow server\n- Use the cli to debug openapi_builder/spec_parser and agent interaction issues before running in MCP/Langflow.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2024 Ray Cromwell\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
