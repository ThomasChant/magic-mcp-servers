  "readme": "# PaymentsNZ MCP Server\n\n## How to Build\n\n1. Install Node.js version 22 or greater. Check version with `node --version`.\n2. Run `cd sdk && npm install && cd ../mcp-server && npm install` to build the SDK and the server.\n\n## How to Run\n\nIf you are not familiar with how to setup MCP Servers with Claude Desktop, see [this tutorial](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) first.\n\nNow add something like this to your Claude Desktop config:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"PaymentsNZ\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"[YOUR-PATH-HERE]/paymentsnz-mcp-server/mcp-server/dist/index.js\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"ACCOUNT_AND_TRANSACTION_API_SPECIFICATION_LIB_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"[YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN-HERE]\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nA `claude_desktop_config.json` file is also provided as reference.\n\nMake sure to set the path to the location where your MCP Server is stored as well as the access token you got after authenticating.\n\n## How to Get Access Token\n\n1. Go to https://pnz-app.azurewebsites.net/\n2. Go to any endpoint such as https://pnz-app.azurewebsites.net/#/typescript/api-endpoints/statements/get-account-statement\n3. Click on `GET AUTH TOKEN` on the top-right of the page and wait for a window to pop-up for consent.\n4. Enter `username` and `password` and approve everything\n5. The access token should now be visible in the Authentication UI(See screenshot below). You can now copy it into your environment variables in your `claude_desktop_config.json` file.\n\nNOTE: The access token does not last more than an hour. Please make sure that it is used in a timely manner.\n\n![Authentication UI](auth.png)\n"
