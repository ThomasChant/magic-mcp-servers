  "readme": "# mcp_email_reader\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) server exposes several mcp tools called search_emails, download_attachment and list_folders. This has been tested on Claude Desktop and LibreChat with Ollama.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n#### Windows\n1. Install Claude Desktop (or another MCP-enabled AI tool)\n   - Download [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) \n   - Follow the current installation instructions: [Installing Claude Desktop](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10065433-installing-claude-for-desktop)\n     \n2. Install Python 3.10 or higher:\n   - Download the latest Python installer from [python.org](https://python.org)\n   - Run the installer, checking \"Add Python to PATH\"\n   - Open Command Prompt and verify installation with `python --version`\n\n3. Install uv:\n   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator\n   - Run `pip install --user uv`\n   - Verify installation with `uv --version`\n\n#### macOS\n1. Install Claude Desktop (or another MCP-enabled AI tool)\n   - Download [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) \n   - Follow the current installation instructions: [Installing Claude Desktop](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10065433-installing-claude-for-desktop)\n     \n2. Install Python 3.10 or higher:\n   - Using Homebrew: `brew install python`\n   - Verify installation with `python3 --version`\n\n3. Install uv:\n   - Using Homebrew: `brew install uv`\n   - Alternatively: `pip3 install --user uv`\n   - Verify installation with `uv --version`\n\n## Configuration\n\nAdd the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"mcp_email_reader\": {\n            \"command\": \"uvx\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"--from\",\n                \"git+https://github.com/karateboss/mcp_email_reader@main\",\n                \"mcp_email_reader\"\n            ],\n        \"env\": {\n            \"IMAP_SERVER\": \"<email server>\",\n            \"EMAIL_ACCOUNT\": \"<user email account>\",\n            \"EMAIL_PASSWORD_ENC\": \"<encrypted password>\"\n            \"EMAIL_SECRET_KEY\": \"<secret key used to encypt password>\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nNote: Clearly, the secret key can be used to decrypt the encrypted password and is therefore a potential security risk - although claude_desktop_config.json is stored locally on your laptop/PC. It has been added to the json file above since it is not possible to add a .env file when using uvx to clone the repo dynamically.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis software package implements the ability to read emails into a MCP enabled framework and is developed by karateboss. \n\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to improve these tools. Please submit issues and pull requests through our repository.\n\n## Support\n\nFor questions and support:\n1. Check our documentation\n2. Submit an issue in our repository\n"
