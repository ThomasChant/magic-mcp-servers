If your MCP host does not support remote MCP servers, don't worry! You can use the [local version of the GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#local-github-mcp-server) instead.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n1. An MCP host that supports the latest MCP specification and remote servers, such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Usage with VS Code\r\n\r\nFor quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start.\r\n\r\n### Usage in other MCP Hosts\r\n\r\nFor MCP Hosts that have been [configured to use the remote GitHub MCP Server](docs/host-integration.md), add the following JSON block to the host's configuration:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"mcp\": {\r\n    \"servers\": {\r\n      \"github\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"http\",\r\n        \"url\": \"https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> **Note:** The exact configuration format may vary by host. Refer to your host's documentation for the correct syntax and location for remote MCP server setup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Remove non-existent get_line_number_in_pull_request_file tool reference by @TheoBrigitte in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/436\r\n* Bump mcp-go to 0.30.0 by @williammartin in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/440\r\n* Remove test that can panic by @williammartin in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/445\r\n* Used typed tool handler for `get_me` tool by @williammartin in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/447\r\n* Bump go-github to v72.0.0 by @radar07 in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/456\r\n* fix: use ENTRYPOINT and CMD for proper argument handling by @JAORMX in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/454\r\n* Fix missing go-github v72 license bump by @williammartin in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/467\r\n* build(deps): bump github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go from 0.30.0 to 0.31.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/465\r\n* Add GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com) to readme by @malantin in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/448\r\n* Reduce fields in `search_users` response by @SamMorrowDrums in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/485\r\n* chore: separate toolset creation from init and use typed error by @SamMorrowDrums in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/487\r\n* fix: move defaulted 'state' param after non-default params in list_code_scanning_alerts by @ph3t in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/488\r\n* docs: add `read-only` instruction to readme by @radar07 in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/490\r\n* Export `ToBoolPtr` and `RequiredParam` by @LuluBeatson in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/495\r\n* Add context toolset and adjust readme by @SamMorrowDrums in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/499\r\n* Fix typo in README.md by @jaril in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/502\r\n* use better raw file handling and return resources by @SamMorrowDrums in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/505\r\n* docs: Update README.md by @SamMorrowDrums in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/508\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @TheoBrigitte made their first contribution in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/436\r\n* @JAORMX made their first contribution in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/454\r\n* @malantin made their first contribution in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/448\r\n* @ph3t made their first contribution in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/488\r\n* @LuluBeatson made their first contribution in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/495\r\n* @jaril made their first contribution in https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/502\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0",

To run the server in a container, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.\n2. Once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running. The image is public; if you get errors on pull, you may have an expired token and need to `docker logout ghcr.io`.\n3. Lastly you will need to [Create a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).\nThe MCP server can use many of the GitHub APIs, so enable the permissions that you feel comfortable granting your AI tools (to learn more about access tokens, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Usage with VS Code\n\nFor quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start.\n\n### Usage in other MCP Hosts\n\nAdd the following JSON block to your IDE MCP settings.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"inputs\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"promptString\",\n        \"id\": \"github_token\",\n        \"description\": \"GitHub Personal Access Token\",\n        \"password\": true\n      }\n    ],\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"github\": {\n        \"command\": \"docker\",\n        \"args\": [\n          \"run\",\n          \"-i\",\n          \"--rm\",\n          \"-e\",\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n          \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n        ],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOptionally, you can add a similar example (i.e. without the mcp key) to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"inputs\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"github_token\",\n      \"description\": \"GitHub Personal Access Token\",\n      \"password\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"github\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-e\",\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n        \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nMore about using MCP server tools in VS Code's [agent mode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).\n\n### Usage with Claude Desktop\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"github\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-e\",\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n        \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Build from source\n\nIf you don't have Docker, you can use `go build` to build the binary in the\n`cmd/github-mcp-server` directory, and use the `github-mcp-server stdio` command with the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable set to your token. To specify the output location of the build, use the `-o` flag. You should configure your server to use the built executable as its `command`. For example:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"github\": {\n        \"command\": \"/path/to/github-mcp-server\",\n        \"args\": [\"stdio\"],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Tool Configuration\n\nThe GitHub MCP Server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of functionalities via the `--toolsets` flag. This allows you to control which GitHub API capabilities are available to your AI tools. Enabling only the toolsets that you need can help the LLM with tool choice and reduce the context size.\n\n_Toolsets are not limited to Tools. Relevant MCP Resources and Prompts are also included where applicable._\n\n### Available Toolsets\n\nThe following sets of tools are available (all are on by default):\n\n| Toolset                 | Description                                                   |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `actions`               | GitHub Actions workflows and CI/CD operations                |\n| `context`               | **Strongly recommended**: Tools that provide context about the current user and GitHub context you are operating in |\n| `code_security`         | Code scanning alerts and security features                    |\n| `issues`                | Issue-related tools (create, read, update, comment)           |\n| `notifications`         | GitHub Notifications related tools                            |\n| `pull_requests`         | Pull request operations (create, merge, review)               |\n| `repos`                 | Repository-related tools (file operations, branches, commits) |\n| `secret_protection`     | Secret protection related tools, such as GitHub Secret Scanning |\n| `users`                 | Anything relating to GitHub Users                             |\n| `experiments`           | Experimental features (not considered stable)                 |\n\n\n#### Specifying Toolsets\n\nTo specify toolsets you want available to the LLM, you can pass an allow-list in two ways:\n\n1. **Using Command Line Argument**:\n\n   ```bash\n   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security\n   ```\n\n2. **Using Environment Variable**:\n   ```bash\n   GITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security\" ./github-mcp-server\n   ```\n\nThe environment variable `GITHUB_TOOLSETS` takes precedence over the command line argument if both are provided.\n\n### Using Toolsets With Docker\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security,experiments\" \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n### The \"all\" Toolset\n\nThe special toolset `all` can be provided to enable all available toolsets regardless of any other configuration:\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --toolsets all\n```\n\nOr using the environment variable:\n\n```bash\nGITHUB_TOOLSETS=\"all\" ./github-mcp-server\n```\n\n## Dynamic Tool Discovery\n\n**Note**: This feature is currently in beta and may not be available in all environments. Please test it out and let us know if you encounter any issues.\n\nInstead of starting with all tools enabled, you can turn on dynamic toolset discovery. Dynamic toolsets allow the MCP host to list and enable toolsets in response to a user prompt. This should help to avoid situations where the model gets confused by the sheer number of tools available.\n\n### Using Dynamic Tool Discovery\n\nWhen using the binary, you can pass the `--dynamic-toolsets` flag.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --dynamic-toolsets\n```\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_DYNAMIC_TOOLSETS=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n## Read-Only Mode\n\nTo run the server in read-only mode, you can use the `--read-only` flag. This will only offer read-only tools, preventing any modifications to repositories, issues, pull requests, etc.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --read-only\n```\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the read-only mode as an environment variable:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_READ_ONLY=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n## GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)\n\nThe flag `--gh-host` and the environment variable `GITHUB_HOST` can be used to set\nthe hostname for GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency.\n\n- For GitHub Enterprise Server, prefix the hostname with the `https://` URI scheme, as it otherwise defaults to `http://`, which GitHub Enterprise Server does not support.\n- For GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency, use `https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.ghe.com` as the hostname.\n``` json\n\"github\": {\n    \"command\": \"docker\",\n    \"args\": [\n    \"run\",\n    \"-i\",\n    \"--rm\",\n    \"-e\",\n    \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n    \"-e\",\n    \"GITHUB_HOST\",\n    \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n    ],\n    \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\",\n        \"GITHUB_HOST\": \"https://<your GHES or ghe.com domain name>\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## i18n / Overriding Descriptions\n\nThe descriptions of the tools can be overridden by creating a\n`github-mcp-server-config.json` file in the same directory as the binary.\n\nThe file should contain a JSON object with the tool names as keys and the new\ndescriptions as values. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION\": \"an alternative description\",\n  \"TOOL_CREATE_BRANCH_DESCRIPTION\": \"Create a new branch in a GitHub repository\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can create an export of the current translations by running the binary with\nthe `--export-translations` flag.\n\nThis flag will preserve any translations/overrides you have made, while adding\nany new translations that have been added to the binary since the last time you\nexported.\n\n```sh\n./github-mcp-server --export-translations\ncat github-mcp-server-config.json\n```\n\nYou can also use ENV vars to override the descriptions. The environment\nvariable names are the same as the keys in the JSON file, prefixed with\n`GITHUB_MCP_` and all uppercase.\n\nFor example, to override the `TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION` tool, you can\nset the following environment variable:\n\n```sh\nexport GITHUB_MCP_TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION=\"an alternative description\"\n```\n\n## Tools\n\n### Users\n\n- **get_me** - Get details of the authenticated user\n  - No parameters required\n\n### Issues\n\n- **get_issue** - Gets the contents of an issue within a repository\n\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `issue_number`: Issue number (number, required)\n\n- **get_issue_comments** - Get comments for a GitHub issue\n\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `issue_number`: Issue number (number, required)\n\n- **create_issue** - Create a new issue in a GitHub repository\n\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `title`: Issue title (string, required)\n  - `body`: Issue body content (string, optional)\n  - `assignees`: Usernames to assign to this issue (string[], optional)\n  - `labels`: Labels to apply to this issue (string[], optional)\n\n- **add_issue_comment** - Add a comment to an issue\n\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `issue_number`: Issue number (number, required)\n  - `body`: Comment text (string, required)\n\n- **list_issues** - List and filter repository issues\n\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `state`: Filter by state ('open', 'closed', 'all') (string, optional)\n  - `labels`: Labels to filter by (string[], optional)\n  - `sort`: Sort by ('created', 'updated', 'comments') (string, optional)\n  - `direction`: Sort direction ('asc', 'desc') (string, optional)\n  - `since`: Filter by date (ISO 8601 timestamp) (string, optional)\n  - `page`: Page number (number, optional)\n  - `perPage`: Results per page (number, optional)\n\n- **update_issue** - Update an existing issue in a GitHub repository\n\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `issue_number`: Issue number to update (number, required)\n  - `title`: New title (string, optional)\n  - `body`: New description (string, optional)\n  - `state`: New state ('open' or 'closed') (string, optional)\n  - `labels`: New labels (string[], optional)\n  - `assignees`: New assignees (string[], optional)\n  - `milestone`: New milestone number (number, optional)\n\n- **search_issues** - Search for issues and pull requests\n  - `query`: Search query (string, required)\n  - `sort`: Sort field (string, optional)\n  - `order`: Sort order (string, optional)\n  - `page`: Page number (number, optional)\n  - `perPage`: Results per page (number, optional)\n\n- **assign_copilot_to_issue** - Assign Copilot to a specific issue in a GitHub repository\n\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `issueNumber`: Issue number (number, required)\n  - _Note_: This tool can help with creating a Pull Request with source code changes to resolve the issue.
