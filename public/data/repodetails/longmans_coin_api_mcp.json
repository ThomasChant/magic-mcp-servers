This server enables AI-powered applications to retrieve cryptocurrency listings, quotes, and detailed information about various coins.\n\n### Available Tools\n\n- `listing-coins` - Fetches a paginated list of all active cryptocurrencies with the latest market data.\n    - `start` (integer, optional): Offset the start (1-based index) of the paginated list of items to return.\n    - `limit` (integer, optional): Number of results to return (default: 10, max: 5000).\n    - `price_min` (number, optional): Minimum USD price to filter results.\n    - `price_max` (number, optional): Maximum USD price to filter results.\n    - `market_cap_min` (number, optional): Minimum market cap to filter results.\n    - `market_cap_max` (number, optional): Maximum market cap to filter results.\n    - `convert` (string, optional): Calculate market quotes in multiple currencies.\n    - `sort` (string, optional): Field to sort the list of cryptocurrencies by.\n    - `sort_dir` (string, optional): Direction to order cryptocurrencies (asc or desc).\n\n- `get-coin-info` - Retrieves detailed information about a specific cryptocurrency.\n    - `id` (string, optional): One or more comma-separated CoinMarketCap cryptocurrency IDs.\n    - `slug` (string, optional): A comma-separated list of cryptocurrency slugs.\n    - `symbol` (string, optional): One or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols.\n\n- `get-coin-quotes` - Fetches the latest market quotes for one or more cryptocurrencies.\n    - `id` (string, optional): One or more comma-separated cryptocurrency CoinMarketCap IDs.\n    - `slug` (string, optional): A comma-separated list of cryptocurrency slugs.\n    - `symbol` (string, optional): One or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Installing via Smithery\n\nTo install Cryptocurrency Data for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/coin-api-mcp):\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install coin-api-mcp --client claude\n```\n\n### Build the Server\nClone this repository and build and install the program with your default Python interpreter (recommended).\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/longmans/coin_api_mcp.git\ncd coin_api_mcp\nuv build\nuv pip install .\n```\n\nAfter installation, you can run it as a script using:\n\n```bash \npython -m coin_api_mcp\n```\n\n\n\n## Configuration\n\n### API Key\n\nThe server requires a CoinMarketCap API key to function. You can obtain one from [CoinMarketCap's website](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/). The API key can be provided in two ways:\n\n1. As an environment variable:\n```bash\nexport COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n```\n\n2. As a command-line argument:\n```bash\npython -m coin_api_mcp --api-key=your_api_key_here\n```\n\n\n### Configure for Claude.app\n\nAdd to your Claude settings:\n\n<details>\n<summary>Using pip installation</summary>\n\n```json\n\"mcpServers\": {\n  \"coin_api\": {\n    \"command\": \"python\",\n    \"args\": [\"-m\", \"coin_api_mcp\"]\n  },\n  \"env\": {\n        \"COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY\": \"your_api_key_here\"\n  }\n}\n```\n</details>\n\nIf you see any issue, you may want to use the full path for the Python interpreter you are using. You can do a `which python` to find out the exact path if needed.\n\nRemember to set the COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY environment variable or provide it via the --api-key argument.\n\n\n## Debugging\n\nYou can use the MCP inspector to debug the server\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe encourage contributions to help expand and improve Coin MCP Server. Whether you want to add new search capabilities, enhance existing functionality, or improve documentation, your input is valuable.\n\nFor examples of other MCP servers and implementation patterns, see:\nhttps://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers\n\nPull requests are welcome! Feel free to contribute new ideas, bug fixes, or enhancements to make Coin MCP Server even more powerful and useful.\n\n## License\n\nCoin MCP Server is licensed under the MIT License. This means you are free to use, modify, and distribute the software, subject to the terms and conditions of the MIT License. For more details, please see the LICENSE file in the project repository."
