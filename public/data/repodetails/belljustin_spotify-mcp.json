  "readme": "# Spotify Model Context Protocol (MCP)\n\nA Spotify MCP for creating playlists based on a description.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.6 or higher\n- Spotify Developer credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Clone this repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-mcp.git\n   cd spotify-mcp\n   ```\n\n2. Install the required dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. Set up your Spotify Developer credentials:\n   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)\n   - Create a new application\n   - Set up your environment variables:\n     ```bash\n     echo SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='your_client_id' >> .env\n     echo SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret' >> .env\n     ```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Starting the Authentication Server\n\n1. Set up your redirect URI in the Spotify Developer Dashboard:\n   - Go to your app in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)\n   - Click \"Edit Settings\"\n   - Add `http://localhost:5000/callback` to the Redirect URIs\n   - Save the changes\n\n2. Start the authentication server:\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n   This will start a local server on port 5000 that handles Spotify OAuth authentication.\n\n3. Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to authenticate with Spotify.\n   After successful authentication, your access token will be saved for use with the MCP.\n\n### Integrating with Cursor\n\n1. Open Cursor and go to Settings\n2. Navigate to the \"Model Context Protocols\" section\n3. Click \"Add MCP\"\n4. Enter the following details in your mcp.json, replacing PATH-TO-BASE-DIR:\n```\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"spotify\": {\n        \"command\": \"uv\",\n        \"args\": [\n          \"--directory\",\n          \"PATH-TO-BASE-DIR/spotify-mcp\",\n          \"run\",\n          \"spotify.py\"\n        ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow you can use the Spotify MCP commands in Cursor to create and manage playlists directly from your editor!\n"
