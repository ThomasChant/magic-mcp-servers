When enabled, a `WebGUI.md` file containing the access address will be created in your `DATA_DIR`.\n\n## 🧭 <a id=\"usage-guide\"></a>Usage Guide\n\nShrimp Task Manager offers a structured approach to AI-assisted programming through guided workflows and systematic task management.\n\n### What is Shrimp?\n\nShrimp is essentially a prompt template that guides AI Agents to better understand and work with your project. It uses a series of prompts to ensure the Agent aligns closely with your project's specific needs and conventions.\n\n### Research Mode in Practice\n\nBefore diving into task planning, you can leverage the research mode for technical investigation and knowledge gathering. This is particularly useful when:\n\n- You need to explore new technologies or frameworks\n- You want to compare different solution approaches\n- You're investigating best practices for your project\n- You need to understand complex technical concepts\n\nSimply tell the Agent \"research [your topic]\" or \"enter research mode for [technology/problem]\" to begin systematic investigation. The research findings will then inform your subsequent task planning and development decisions.\n\n### First-Time Setup\n\nWhen working with a new project, simply tell the Agent \"init project rules\". This will guide the Agent to generate a set of rules tailored to your project's specific requirements and structure.\n\n### Task Planning Process\n\nTo develop or update features, use the command \"plan task [your description]\". The system will reference the previously established rules, attempt to understand your project, search for relevant code sections, and propose a comprehensive plan based on the current state of your project.\n\n### Feedback Mechanism\n\nDuring the planning process, Shrimp guides the Agent through multiple steps of thinking. You can review this process and provide feedback if you feel it's heading in the wrong direction. Simply interrupt and share your perspective - the Agent will incorporate your feedback and continue the planning process.\n\n### Task Execution\n\nWhen you're satisfied with the plan, use \"execute task [task name or ID]\" to implement it. If you don't specify a task name or ID, the system will automatically identify and execute the highest priority task.\n\n### Continuous Mode\n\nIf you prefer to execute all tasks in sequence without manual intervention for each task, use \"continuous mode\" to automatically process the entire task queue.\n\n### Token Limitation Note\n\nDue to LLM token limits, context may be lost during lengthy conversations. If this occurs, simply open a new chat session and ask the Agent to continue execution. The system will pick up where it left off without requiring you to repeat the task details or context.\n\n### Prompt Language and Customization\n\nYou can switch the language of system prompts by setting the `TEMPLATES_USE` environment variable. It supports `en` (English) and `zh` (Traditional Chinese) by default. Furthermore, you can copy an existing template directory (e.g., `src/prompts/templates_en`) to the location specified by `DATA_DIR`, modify it, and then point `TEMPLATES_USE` to your custom template directory name. This allows for deeper prompt customization. For detailed instructions.\n\n## 🔬 <a id=\"research-mode\"></a>Research Mode\n\nShrimp Task Manager includes a specialized research mode designed for systematic technical investigation and knowledge gathering.\n\n### What is Research Mode?\n\nResearch Mode is a guided workflow system that helps AI Agents conduct thorough and systematic technical research.

This helps maintain consistency and quality as complexity increases.\n\nUse the `init_project_rules` tool to set up or update project standards when:\n\n- Starting a new large-scale project\n- Onboarding new team members\n- Implementing major architectural changes\n- Adopting new development conventions\n\n### Usage Examples\n\nYou can easily access this feature with simple natural language commands:\n\n- **For initial setup**: Simply tell the Agent \"init rules\" or \"init project rules\"\n- **For updates**: When your project evolves, tell the Agent \"Update rules\" or \"Update project rules\"\n\nThis tool is particularly valuable when your codebase expands or undergoes significant structural changes, helping maintain consistent development practices throughout the project lifecycle.\n\n## 📚 <a id=\"documentation\"></a>Documentation Resources\n\n- [Prompt Customization Guide](docs/en/prompt-customization.md): Instructions for customizing tool prompts via environment variables\n- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md): Record of all notable changes to this project\n\n## 🔧 <a id=\"installation\"></a>Installation and Usage\n\n### Installing via Smithery\n\nTo install Shrimp Task Manager for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@cjo4m06/mcp-shrimp-task-manager):\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install @cjo4m06/mcp-shrimp-task-manager --client claude\n```\n\n### Manual Installation\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Build and start service\nnpm run build\n```\n\n## 🔌 <a id=\"clients\"></a>Using with MCP-Compatible Clients\n\nShrimp Task Manager can be used with any client that supports the Model Context Protocol, such as Cursor IDE.\n\n### Configuration in Cursor IDE\n\nShrimp Task Manager offers two configuration methods: global configuration and project-specific configuration.\n\n#### Global Configuration\n\n1. Open the Cursor IDE global configuration file (usually located at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`)\n2. Add the following configuration in the `mcpServers` section:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"shrimp-task-manager\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/mcp-shrimp-task-manager/dist/index.js\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DATA_DIR\": \"/path/to/project/data\", // 必須使用絕對路徑\n        \"TEMPLATES_USE\": \"en\",\n        \"ENABLE_GUI\": \"false\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nor\n\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"shrimp-task-manager\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-shrimp-task-manager\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DATA_DIR\": \"/mcp-shrimp-task-manager/data\",\n        \"TEMPLATES_USE\": \"en\",\n        \"ENABLE_GUI\": \"false\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> ⚠️ Please replace `/mcp-shrimp-task-manager` with your actual path.\n\n#### Project-Specific Configuration\n\nYou can also set up dedicated configurations for each project to use independent data directories for different projects:\n\n1. Create a `.cursor` directory in the project root\n2. Create an `mcp.json` file in this directory with the following content:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"shrimp-task-manager\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/mcp-shrimp-task-manager/dist/index.js\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DATA_DIR\": \"/path/to/project/data\", // Must use absolute path\n        \"TEMPLATES_USE\": \"en\",\n        \"ENABLE_GUI\": \"false\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nor\n\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"shrimp-task-manager\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-shrimp-task-manager\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DATA_DIR\": \"/path/to/project/data\", // Must use absolute path\n        \"TEMPLATES_USE\": \"en\",\n        \"ENABLE_GUI\": \"false\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### ⚠️ Important Configuration Notes\n\nThe **DATA_DIR parameter** is the directory where Shrimp Task Manager stores task data, conversation logs, and other information. Setting this parameter correctly is crucial for the normal operation of the system. This parameter must use an **absolute path**; using a relative path may cause the system to incorrectly locate the data directory, resulting in data loss or function failure.\n\n> **Warning**: Using relative paths may cause the following issues:\n>\n> - Data files not found, causing system initialization failure\n> - Task status loss or inability to save correctly\n> - Inconsistent application behavior across different environments\n> - System crashes or failure to start\n\n### 🔧 Environment Variable Configuration\n\nShrimp Task Manager supports customizing prompt behavior through environment variables, allowing you to fine-tune AI assistant responses without modifying code. You can set these variables in the configuration or through an `.env` file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"shrimp-task-manager\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/mcp-shrimp-task-manager/dist/index.js\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DATA_DIR\": \"/path/to/project/data\",\n        \"MCP_PROMPT_PLAN_TASK\": \"Custom planning guidance...\",\n        \"MCP_PROMPT_EXECUTE_TASK_APPEND\": \"Additional execution instructions...\",\n        \"TEMPLATES_USE\": \"en\",\n        \"ENABLE_GUI\": \"false\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThere are two customization methods:\n\n- **Override Mode** (`MCP_PROMPT_[FUNCTION_NAME]`): Completely replace the default prompt\n- **Append Mode** (`MCP_PROMPT_[FUNCTION_NAME]_APPEND`): Add content to the existing prompt\n\nAdditionally, there are other system configuration variables:\n\n- **DATA_DIR**: Specifies the directory where task data is stored\n- **TEMPLATES_USE**: Specifies the template set to use for prompts. Defaults to `en`. Currently available options are `en` and `zh`. To use custom templates, copy the `src/prompts/templates_en` directory to the location specified by `DATA_DIR`, rename the copied directory (e.g., to `my_templates`), and set `TEMPLATES_USE` to the new directory name (e.g., `my_templates`).\n\nFor detailed instructions on customizing prompts, including supported parameters and examples, see the [Prompt Customization Guide](docs/en/prompt-customization.md).\n\n## 💡 <a id=\"prompt\"></a>System Prompt Guidance\n\n### Cursor IDE Configuration\n\nYou can enable Cursor Settings => Features => Custom modes, and configure the following two modes:\n\n#### TaskPlanner Mode\n\n```\nYou are a professional task planning expert. You must interact with users, analyze their needs, and collect project-related information. Finally, you must use \"plan_task\" to create tasks. When the task is created, you must summarize it and inform the user to use the \"TaskExecutor\" mode to execute the task.\nYou must focus on task planning. Do not use \"execute_task\" to execute tasks.\nSerious warning: you are a task planning expert, you cannot modify the program code directly, you can only plan tasks, and you cannot modify the program code directly, you can only plan tasks.\n```\n\n#### TaskExecutor Mode\n\n```\nYou are a professional task execution expert. When a user specifies a task to execute, use \"execute_task\" to execute the task.\nIf no task is specified, use \"list_tasks\" to find unexecuted tasks and execute them.\nWhen the execution is completed, a summary must be given to inform the user of the conclusion.\nYou can only perform one task at a time, and when a task is completed, you are prohibited from performing the next task unless the user explicitly tells you to.\nIf the user requests \"continuous mode\", all tasks will be executed in sequence.\n```\n\n> 💡 Choose the appropriate mode based on your needs:\n>\n> - Use **TaskPlanner** mode when planning tasks\n> - Use **TaskExecutor** mode when executing tasks\n\n### Using with Other Tools\n\nIf your tool doesn't support Custom modes, you can:\n\n- Manually paste the appropriate prompts at different stages\n- Or directly use simple commands like `Please plan the following task: ......` or `Please start executing the task...`\n\n## 🛠️ <a id=\"tools\"></a>Available Tools Overview\n\nAfter configuration, you can use the following tools:\n\n| Category                     | Tool Name            | Description                                      |\n| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Task Planning**            | `plan_task`          | Start planning tasks                             |\n| **Task Analysis**            | `analyze_task`       | In-depth analysis of task requirements           |\n|                              | `process_thought`    | Step-by-step reasoning for complex problems      |\n| **Solution Assessment**      | `reflect_task`       | Reflect and improve solution concepts            |\n| **Research & Investigation** | `research_mode`      | Enter systematic technical research mode         |\n| **Project Management**       | `init_project_rules` | Initialize or update project standards and rules |\n| **Task Management**          | `split_tasks`        | Break tasks into subtasks                        |\n|                              | `list_tasks`         | Display all tasks and status                     |\n|                              | `query_task`         | Search and list tasks                            |\n|                              | `get_task_detail`    | Display complete task details                    |\n|                              | `delete_task`        | Delete incomplete tasks                          |\n| **Task Execution**           | `execute_task`       | Execute specific tasks                           |\n|                              | `verify_task`        | Verify task completion                           |\n\n## 🔧 Technical Implementation\n\n- **Node.js**: High-performance JavaScript runtime environment\n- **TypeScript**: Provides type-safe development environment\n- **MCP SDK**: Interface for seamless interaction with large language models\n- **UUID**: Generate unique and reliable task identifiers\n\n## 📄 <a id=\"license\"></a>License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n\n## <a id=\"recommended\"></a>Recommended Models\n\nFor the best experience, we recommend using the following models:\n\n- **Claude 3.7**: Offers strong understanding and generation capabilities.\n- **Gemini 2.5**: Google's latest model, performs excellently.\n\nDue to differences in training methods and understanding capabilities across models, using other models might lead to varying results for the same prompts.
