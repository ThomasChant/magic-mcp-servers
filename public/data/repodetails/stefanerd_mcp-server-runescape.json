Add the MCP server in your config (NPM Package)\n\nPaste this snippet in your mcp config that your client is using\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-server-runescape\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-server-runescape\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can find the config file in (mac):\n\n- Claude desktop:\n\n`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n- Cursor:\n\n`/Users/name/.cursor/mcp.json`\n\n### 2. From Source\n\n**Required** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your system\n\n1. Clone this repository\n2. Install dependencies:\n   ```bash   \n   yarn\n   ```\n   or\n   ```bash   \n   npm install\n   ```\n3. Then update your Claude desktop or Cursor with:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"mcp-server-runescape\": {\n         \"command\": \"node\",\n         \"args\": [\"/Users/path/to/mcp-server-runescape/src/server.js\"]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n4. **Optional**: Run the debugger/inspector\n   ```bash\n   yarn dev\n   ```\n   or\n   ```bash   \n   npm run build\n   ```\n\nMake sure to:\n\n- Replace `/path/to/mcp-server-runescape` with the actual path to your installation.\n\nAfter updating the configuration, restart Claude desktop or Cursor for the changes to take effect.\n\n#### Personal preference\n\nYou can use any client you want, my personal preference goes to Cursor at the moment in combination with deepseek-v3.1 which is performing really well.\n\n[List of clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients)\n\n## API Documentation\n\nFor detailed information about the Runescape API endpoints used by this MCP server, visit:\n[RS/Wiki API](https://runescape.wiki/w/Application_programming_interface)\n\n## Thank you\n\nI built this over the weekend, to learn a bit more about MCP servers. Runescape was the perfect subject to try it out on.\n\n- Shout out to the rs/wiki team for the docs and API.\n\nIf this helps you out in anyway when scaping and you would like to support me, feel free to\n\n[![\"Buy Me A Coffee\"](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://buymeacoffee.com/stefanxyz)\n"
