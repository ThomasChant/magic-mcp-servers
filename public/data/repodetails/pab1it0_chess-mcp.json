If you don't have Docker installed, you can get it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).\n\n\nEdit your Claude Desktop config file:\n* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n* Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n* Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\nThen add the following configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chess\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"pab1it0/chess-mcp\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Running with UV\n\nAlternatively, you can run the server directly using UV. Edit your Claude Desktop config file (locations listed above) and add the server configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chess\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--directory\",\n        \"<full path to chess-mcp directory>\",\n        \"run\",\n        \"src/chess_mcp/main.py\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> Note: if you see `Error: spawn uv ENOENT` in [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/desktop), you may need to specify the full path to `uv` or set the environment variable `NO_UV=1` in the configuration.\n\n## Development\n\nContributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any suggestions or improvements.\n\nThis project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage dependencies. Install `uv` following the instructions for your platform:\n\n```bash\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n\nYou can then create a virtual environment and install the dependencies with:\n\n```bash\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS\n.venv\\Scripts\\activate     # On Windows\nuv pip install -e .\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nThe project includes a test suite that ensures functionality and helps prevent regressions.\n\nRun the tests with pytest:\n\n```bash\n# Install development dependencies\nuv pip install -e \".[dev]\"\n\n# Run the tests\npytest\n\n# Run with coverage report\npytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing\n```\n\n## Available Tools\n\n### Player Information\n- `get_player_profile` - Get a player's profile from Chess.com\n- `get_player_stats` - Get a player's stats from Chess.com\n- `is_player_online` - Check if a player is currently online on Chess.com\n- `get_titled_players` - Get a list of titled players from Chess.com\n\n### Games\n- `get_player_current_games` - Get a player's ongoing games on Chess.com\n- `get_player_games_by_month` - Get a player's games for a specific month from Chess.com\n- `get_player_game_archives` - Get a list of available monthly game archives for a player on Chess.com\n- `download_player_games_pgn` - Download PGN files for all games in a specific month from Chess.com\n\n### Clubs\n- `get_club_profile` - Get information about a club on Chess.com\n- `get_club_members` - Get members of a club on Chess.com\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n---\n\n[mcp]: https://modelcontextprotocol.io"
